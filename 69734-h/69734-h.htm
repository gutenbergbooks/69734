  <h2 class='c013'>FOREWORD<br /> <br /><span class='sc'>Letter from Dr Norman Haire</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>My dear Ludovici</span>,</p>
<p class='c015'>It has been a great pleasure for me to
read <i>Lysistrata</i>—it is so stimulating.
Whether one agrees with your views or
not (and I disagree with many of them),
the book impels one to re-examine one’s
standards of value, and that is the highest
function a book can perform.</p>

<p class='c015'>Perhaps I am prejudiced, but to me you
seem very hard on the medical profession.
With the present idiotic system of paying
the doctor better for illness than for
health the wonder is, not that we doctors
have so many faults, but that we have so
few. In a saner age we shall get a
retaining fee for keeping each person or
group of persons well, and so, in order to
avoid excessive work, if for no higher
motive, we shall aim at preventing disease
rather than at alleviating it. To a large
extent we do that now, in spite of the
fact that it takes money out of our
pockets.</p>

<p class='c015'>Your exhortation to breast-feed babies
is backed by all but a few cranks, and I
find your suggestion to make confinement
easier by proper diet during pregnancy
very interesting. I remember that at the
obstetric hospital at which I was trained
we used to notice that patients who had
been on special treatment for albuminuria
had, in general, easy confinements. It is
very significant, from the standpoint of
your suggestions, that in the diet of these
patients the protein element had been
very greatly reduced. I shall follow up
your idea and let you know the result.</p>

<p class='c015'>I am sure you are right when you say
“Sound and desirable women cannot be
happy unmated.” The fact that there
are some women who can does not invalidate
the general truth—they are
atypical.</p>

<p class='c015'>Another of your phrases I would that
you should trumpet forth in a voice that
should reach to the uttermost ends of the
earth: “Strictly speaking, moral depravity
is no more voluntary than
physiological depravity.” I am confident
that as Science advances the former
will be found always to depend on the
latter.</p>

<p class='c015'>In speaking of the unfit, infanticide, and
concubinage, your frankness is splendid,
though on my pet subject, Birth-Control,
I disagree with you. There can be no
doubt that much of our present-day
“humanitarianism” only results in
wasting on the hopelessly unfit money
and care which might be spent very
profitably on the fit, and in keeping alive
those who should never have been born.
With the decay of sentimentalism, infanticide
must come to be practised on
those who at birth are obviously below a
(variable) minimum standard, and sterilization
(destruction of fertility without
interference with sexual potency or
pleasure) on those whose deficiency
becomes unmistakable only at a more
advanced age. Contraception will be
used mainly to ensure an optimum
interval between births in the interest of
both mother and child, and to limit the
offspring to a (variable) number most
suitable in the individual, financial, and
social circumstances of each family.</p>

<p class='c015'>Some modification of our present
marriage-arrangement is inevitable, and
concubinage seems quite a probable
solution. At present we pretend to
be a monogamous people in spite of
widespread fornication and adultery,
overtly with prostitutes and covertly
with “amateurs.” But sooner or later
we shall have to drop the pretence and
admit that men are polygamous. (A few
men are monogamous, and a few women
polyandrous, but both are exceptions.)
Surely it would be better to allow every
woman to have half a husband, if she
wants to, and remain respectable, than
to give half the women a whole husband
and the others no share in a husband at all.</p>

<p class='c015'>For this book you will probably be
denounced as a daring and fantastic
visionary, and I shall be blamed as an
aider and abettor, but that doesn’t
matter. It will have stimulated many
unthinking people to a re-examination of
their table of values.</p>
<p class='c016'>Ever yours,</p>
<p class='c017'><span class='sc'>Norman Haire</span></p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c013'>INTRODUCTION<br /> <br /><span class='sc'>Values direct Science</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>From</span> a brief survey of his fellow-countrymen,
there are many strange
lessons to be learnt in England to-day,
by anyone who keeps his eyes open and
is on his guard against taking too much
for granted.</p>
<p class='c015'>The observer has only to exchange a
few words with the men, women, and
children he passes by, and to look into
their faces—no more is required to tell
him all he wishes to know. Nor will he
need to have a very high standard of
human beauty to feel disappointed by the
features of the great majority, while the
most elementary knowledge of psychology
and hygiene will enable him to see from
their behaviour and expressions that they
are very largely harassed, unhealthy and
badly fed (<i>i.e.</i>, not starving, but improperly
nourished).</p>

<p class='c015'>But among the first of the curious facts
he will notice is this—that large masses of
his fellow-countrymen appear to have
become so thoroughly accustomed to
living their lives with the help of every
variety of artificial aids that the latter
no longer provoke either shame or concern.</p>

<p class='c015'>For instance, men and women—young
and old—constantly pass by wearing
glasses, and they look quite cheerfully
and confidently up through these optical
aids when they are addressed. To speak
to others in the crowd, and to see them
smile, is to recognize instantly that some
or all of their teeth are bad or false. But
they smile with just as much conviction,
whether their dentition happens to be
natural or manufactured. Numbers of
the younger adults and children about
have upon their faces, in the region of
their eyes and brows, certain tiny, almost
imperceptible, scars, revealing the fact
that they were brought into the world
by means of obstetric instruments. And
countless others there are whose birth
was just as artificial, though they bear
no marks to show it. But no one seems
to trouble, or to inquire how such frequent
interference with a natural function
might be avoided. Everywhere people are
seen shaking hands, and sincerely proclaiming
themselves “Quite well,” when
that very morning, and many previous
mornings, their intestines have functioned
only through the agency of some widely
advertized artificial aid. But none of them
feels guilty of any grave inaccuracy in
declaring himself well in the circumstances.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mothers can be seen by the hundred
thousand, serenely wheeling in perambulators,
or leading by the hand, infants and
children, not one of whom has ever put
its lips to a human breast. The advertisements
recommending the artificial
foods on which these infants and children
have been reared can be read on every
boarding. But it never occurs either to
the mothers themselves, or to the children,
or to the onlookers, to consider whether
this state of affairs is of a kind that
justifies so much self-complacency, good
cheer, indifference, and apparent contentment.</p>

<p class='c015'>These indications of a highly standardized
life, revealing almost universal imperfections
of some kind in our bodies and
their functions, are now so common, so
much a commonplace in our midst, that
nobody notices them, nobody mentions
them as odd, and certainly nobody seems
to show any concern or alarm about their
monotonous frequency.</p>

<p class='c015'>Mention might be made of other less
obvious aids to normal functions which
are in daily use among the population
of these islands; but, since we are
speaking of the lessons that may be
learned by an ordinary observer who
keeps his eyes and ears open in our
streets and lanes, we may well confine
ourselves to the obvious.</p>

<p class='c015'>Now, since all marked uniformity can
result only from holding similar fundamental
views, similar general principles,
in common, if our wanderer wishes to
pursue his observations he may be led
to inquire from what substratum of
guiding rules, from what basic values,
this uniformity arises. If he is right in
concluding that the population he sees
about him—the people who are regarded
as well and healthy, not the people who
crowd our hospitals, asylums, and homes
for cripples and incurables!—are largely
sub-normal, or sub-human, in the sense
that they are neither complete bodily
nor capable of functioning without artificial
aids; if, moreover, he is right in
thinking that they do not seem to be
much perturbed about their sub-humanity,
he may wish to know the nature of
the atmosphere in which their thoughts
and ideals are formed. Their readiness
to declare themselves “quite well,” or
“quite fit,” simply on the strength of
their not being under a doctor, or on a
sick-bed, is singular. The question they
ask themselves is not “Am I really quite
fit or well?” but “Am I just able to
discharge my daily duties, walk about,
shop, have a family, and take ordinary
meals?” If they can answer this question
in the affirmative, they reply with no
conscious insincerity that they are quite
fit.</p>

<p class='c015'>Evidently, then, among this population
of to-day there is no severe standard of
good bodily condition, no cultivated taste
about it. Or, if there is, it is surprisingly
low.</p>

<p class='c015'>Defective functioning and incomplete
bodily equipment no longer debars anybody
from regarding himself, or from
being regarded by others, as desirable and
normal. Even in the vital matter of
mating, this is so—how much more
customary it must be, therefore, in less
vital matters! Stand up, smile, and
agitate your four limbs to indicate that
they are intact and still movable, and
that is enough. The bias against a
whole list of defects and blemishes has
completely disappeared.</p>

<p class='c015'>Moral depravity is still stigmatized.
About physiological depravity, however,
the world is frivolously indifferent. In
the popular novels, which best reflect the
spirit of the age, the heroine rejects a
suitor, not because he has false teeth or
chronic dyspepsia or varicose veins—such
things are so common that they are
never mentioned; but because he is
“selfish,” or lacking in chivalry, or in
“a sense of humour.” The hero whom
she accepts may be less healthy, less
complete anatomically than the man she
rejects. He may also function less normally,
have two or three false teeth and a
furred tongue—in fact, he may be in
every respect a much less desirable potential
sire; but she considers his “soul,”
as the expression goes; and every reader
is satisfied that she behaves in the best
possible way.</p>

<p class='c015'>The spiritual atmosphere of our population,
therefore, is one in which all stress
seems to be laid on the soul, in which the
severe standards are soul standards, and
in which the importance of the body and
its completeness are almost entirely
overlooked. As an instance of this, it is
interesting to note that there is no such
thing to-day as a guilty conscience about
bodily depravity. The results of hundreds
of years of steady moralization has
ended at last in the condition known as
“guilty conscience” becoming restricted
entirely to the soul and to the moral life.
To say that so-and-so “can’t help it,”
immediately stifles criticism and arrests
nausea. This alone shows how purely
moral our outlook is. Least of all are
people able to despise themselves when
their own teeth are false, or when they
habitually assist normal functioning by
means of artificial aids.</p>

<p class='c015'>And in all these matters the unanimity
of the modern civilized world is so striking
that the conclusion is forced upon us
that here we are confronted with the
outcome of certain ruling and fundamental
values which must be common to all the
people we have been discussing. From
the nature of the uniform attitude to
which these values have led, we are also
obliged to infer that they must have
taught at least two very definite doctrines
with unswerving consistency—(a) the
over-emphasis of the importance of the
soul, and (b) the contempt and general
slander of the body. Or, to put it less
offensively, they must have taught mankind
not only to place soul always before
body, but also to leave the body out of
the reckoning when valuing the quality
of human beings.</p>

<p class='c015'>So much we know must have occurred,
and we come to this conclusion merely
from judging the results which we see
about us to-day. When, however, we
set out to inquire into the history of our
population, and attempt to discover
whether such values have indeed operated
in forming their spiritual atmosphere,
then, not only are our suspicions abundantly
confirmed, but we are actually
able to lay our finger on the body of
doctrine containing the values whose
existence we posited <i>a priori</i>.</p>

<p class='c015'>Having attained this end, while we
may still continue to deplore the results
we see about us, we can no longer wonder
at them. Indeed, we should marvel if,
in such an atmosphere, we had failed to
degenerate, or ceased from degenerating.
The wonder is, not that we have become
a nation of decadents and crocks, but
that it should have taken all this time to
make us such a nation.</p>

<p class='c015'>If our values had not for scores of
generations turned us away from strict
standards concerning the body, it is
inconceivable that we should have become
what we are; it is inconceivable that
this atmosphere of toleration and indifference
towards bodily defects should have
become so universal. A nation ultimately
becomes the image of its values.
The values are the die, the nation is the
coin. From the face of the coin we judge
the die. From the faces of modern
English people we can judge their values.</p>

<p class='c015'>Moreover, these values must have been
so deeply rooted that they now mould
opinion without those whose opinion is
moulded by them being conscious of the
source of their mental attitude. The
best illustration of this is that, although
these values ultimately derive from a
great religion, the most irreligious people
of the modern world share with the
religious the spiritual atmosphere we
have been describing. People no longer
believing in the soul from the religious
standpoint, nevertheless show by their
tolerance towards bodily defects, in
themselves and others, that they are being
unconsciously influenced by the same
atmosphere. They may even have ceased
to identify their opinions with any fundamental
values whatsoever, and regard
their attitude as quite original, as many,
particularly women, do. No matter!
Let them reveal just that significant
difference of standards in their judgment
of human “fitness” and their judgment
of the “fitness” of animals, and
we know the ancestry of their mental
attitude.</p>

<p class='c015'>For this reason it is surely somewhat
muddle-headed on the part of a writer
like Dean Inge, situated as he is, to plead
with such vehemence on behalf of
Eugenics. For how can we hope for a
reaction in favour of the body as long as
the values which lay all stress on the soul
and despise the body abide as an influence
among us? Are they not the values
by which he stands, and which he is
officially expected to inculcate upon his
generation?<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c018'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f1'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Mr. G. K. Chesterton is more consistent
here, and shows a deeper understanding of his
true position. He, like Dean Inge, accepts the
fundamental values which by slow degrees have
brought the modern world into existence, and
he therefore very rationally rejects Eugenics.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>If ever these values are proved before
the whole world to be false, and cease
to exercise any influence, no eugenic
effort will then be required. Because,
the moment we begin to value people
according to their physiological <i>as well
as</i> their spiritual worth—the moment,
that is to say, we value them according
to the promise which they give in their
own bodies and minds of guaranteeing
the survival of human life in a desirable
form, eugenic mating will become quite
as common and instinctive as dysgenic
mating is to-day.</p>

<p class='c015'>Dean Inge, while recognizing the widespread
degeneracy and physiological
botchedness to which allusion has been
made, does not seem to perceive, as our
observer has, the singular readiness with
which all modern people overlook or
condone it in themselves and others,
and he argues, plausibly enough, that our
regrettable physical condition is due to
our industrialism and hypertrophic
urbanism.</p>

<p class='c015'>But this is tantamount to regarding the
latest accompanying symptom of our
condition as its chief cause. For, in the
first place, it is extremely doubtful
whether the Industrial Revolution could
ever have come about without that
contempt for the body and its needs
which lies embedded in our ruling values.
Secondly, does Dean Inge find no signs of
that contempt of the body before the
Industrial Age? How about the Middle
Ages? How about the Great Rebellion
in England? The present writer once
went to the pains of tracing all the Puritan
contempt for the body, and the fatal
consequences it had for the English
people, to the values that Dean Inge
upholds. He was even able to show that,
without those values, the seeds of modern
industrialism could hardly have been
sown, as they were in the middle of the
seventeenth century.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c018'><sup>[2]</sup></a> Was not this before
the so-called Industrial Revolution?</p>

<div class='fn'>

and Co., London: 1915).</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>How could the food-conditions in this
country ever have become as appalling
as they are without an old tradition
involving the neglect of bodily concerns?
These things antecede the Industrial
Revolution, as the present writer has
shown elsewhere, by hundreds of years.
Evidently, then, strict standards about
the body had already gone long before
the Industrial Age. And, when the
latter came, it found no barriers in the
English people’s prejudices regarding the
body and health: otherwise it could
never have proceeded as successfully as
it did to a further debilitation of the
national physique.</p>

<p class='c015'>We may take it, then, that the spiritual
environment of all modern sub-human
people is the outcome of our fundamental
values, as is also their sub-humanity;
and that this spiritual environment is
characterized by a tendency to neglect
and despise the body and bodily considerations.</p>

<p class='c015'>At all events, to put it in the mildest
and most moderate terms, it is impossible
<i>altogether to absolve these fundamental
values from responsibility in the matter</i>;
and to ignore their influence, and to join
the Eugenic movement, without first
reckoning with their power, as Dean Inge
has done, is to be guilty of a confusion of
thought unworthy of anyone who professes
to guide public opinion.</p>

<p class='c015'>Now what is the material environment
of our population?—Quite clearly, it is
one in which the mechanical elaboration
of daily life has been carried to a degree
entirely bewildering. These sub-human
people of the twentieth century live among
marvels of technical skill and ingenuity;
and the appliances, apparatus, and general
equipment of their every-day life have
reached a complexity and perfection
quite unprecedented in history. Far
from having learnt any lesson from the
doctrines Darwin taught last century,
all our energy and skill have been concentrated
in precisely the opposite direction.
Progressive evolution is no longer
a fact with us; for, as a species we are
steadily falling back to a level below that
attained by our race in former ages.
While we ourselves, however, steadily
recede along the scale of quality, our
environmental conditions, our tools, our
means, acquire ever greater perfection.</p>

<p class='c015'>The onus of evolution has, as it were,
been transferred from our own shoulders
to the shoulders of our environment.
Blinded by the dazzling achievements of
the mechanical and other sciences, we
still speak about ourselves as if it were we,
as living organisms, who were continuing
to evolve. But, truth to tell, it is nothing
of the sort. Even in the sphere of intellectual
powers, we are miserably below
standards already achieved.</p>

<p class='c015'>To the bulk of unobservant and unthinking
mankind, this state of affairs is
largely hidden; because, while science
increases the efficiency of our extra-corporeal
equipment, it has also, <i>pari
passu</i> with our degeneration, provided us
with the means of keeping our corporeal
equipment going. Almost as fast as we
have wanted them, the sciences of
chemistry and of medicine have given us
the means of replacing lost parts of our
bodies, and of supplementing failing
functions. A whole sphere of activity—indeed
a whole world of interests and
ingenuity—has been created by modern
physical degeneracy. The patent-medicine,
patent-appliance, and patent-food
industries, alone represent some of the
largest going concerns in the land. In
fact, it might be said that these industries
themselves are but the reverse of the
medal representing our fundamental
values. Where you have values such as
ours, you will necessarily possess a huge
and flourishing medical profession and a
vast army of dentists, chemists, and
osteopaths, daily directing their wits
towards making good the increasing
defects of the human body. You will also
be compelled to have your patent-drug,
patent-appliance, and patent-food magnates,
who, taking advantage of the
universal physiological depravity of their
contemporaries, amass large fortunes in
merely offering “salvation” at popular
prices to the physiologically depraved.</p>

<p class='c015'>To be strictly logical, even the nature
of scientific research should be added to
the consequences of a people’s ruling
values; because the ultimate goal of scientific
investigation is necessarily determined
by the desiderata implicit in values. If
the values of an age tend more and more
towards tolerating bodily defects, and
towards securing satisfaction merely by
patching or artificially replacing them,
scientific research will concentrate ever
more and more on those discoveries which
promise either to alleviate physical degeneration
or else to conceal it. And, as
fast as we slough off further parts of our
bodies, or lose further powers of functioning,
we may rely upon science being ever
ready with artificial aids, to make our
lives just possible notwithstanding.</p>

<p class='c015'>In this way, <i>values direct science</i>. If
we altered our ruling values, we should
find that the direction of science was also
altered, because the desiderata always
implicit in ruling values would then have
changed.</p>

<p class='c015'>“But,” cry the modernists <i>à outrance</i>,
“if science is ever ready, and will continue
to be ever ready, with artificial aids
to make good the losses in our corporeal
equipment and efficiency, why all this fuss
and pother? Why worry?”</p>

<p class='c015'>Now this view, tacitly held or openly
professed by the bulk of modern mankind
to-day, would be all very well, and would
justify a certain modicum of optimistic
contentment, if we could act and think,
and continue to reproduce our kind in a
desirable form, independently of our
bodies. But, unfortunately for the
modern man, this is impossible. Not only
that, but a good many of life’s joys—some
of its greatest and most lasting—are
connected precisely with the reproduction
of our kind, with the maintenance of our
bodily efficiency, and with happy functioning.
The moment physiological
serenity goes, the moment a function
ceases to be a pleasure, the body becomes
the most tyrannical and insistent pleader
against Life. It constantly sets the
most formidable question-mark against
the value of Life.</p>

<p class='c015'>The pleasures of the healthily functioning
body are very real pleasures. They
constitute a very large proportion of the
sum of joy on earth. And nothing can
be more obvious than that Nature means
them to contribute largely to this sum of
joy. To eat with false teeth is not as
pleasant as to eat with natural teeth.
Artificially to promote either appetite
or digestion soon proves but a poor and
delusive imitation of Nature’s way. To
wear glasses is not as good as to be without
them. Neither is the face or the expression
of one who always wears glasses
as attractive as the face and the expression
of one who does not. To a mother,
the hand-feeding of her infant child is
not the unforgettable experience that
breast-feeding is. And, in the deepest
and most rapturous transports of love,
where a large proportion of the ecstasy
depends upon the bodily savouriness and
sweetness of the couple involved, natural
and normal physiological equipment is of
paramount importance. A clean mouth,
full of natural teeth, firmly set in unimpaired
gums; a clean fresh tongue, not
even slightly furred by incipient chronic
indigestion; a sweet breath, and the
natural fragrance of a healthily functioning
body!—who knows love as Nature
intended him to know it if he has not
known these things?</p>

<p class='c015'>And yet, how many modern men and
women ever can know love in this form?
How is it possible?</p>

<p class='c015'>Can it be wondered at, therefore, that
modern mankind as a whole are beginning
to suspect that the <i>joie de vivre</i> is grossly
over-rated? Can it be wondered at that
the bulk of mankind are beginning to feel
that life can well be lived without love?</p>

<p class='c015'>This, then, is the disillusionment that
follows on the heels of the values directing
our scientific progress. While,
through them, we are content to exist despite
our defective bodily equipment, we
are gradually weaned from our love of life
and from our deepest convictions concerning
the value of life. For not only
does our debilitated or incomplete body
itself give us but second-rate joys, but
the science that comes to our aid offers
us only substitutes, and we are apt to
measure the value of life according to
those second-rate joys, and according
also to the level of happiness attained by
means of these substitutes.</p>

<p class='c015'>Thus the values that revile both life
and the body in the end succeed in making
both life and the body vile.</p>

<p class='c015'>So much for the æsthetic side, which is
important, because life is very largely
an æsthetic phenomenon. But there are
even more serious consequences than
these. For instance, it is highly improbable
that our vitality and intellectuality
can fail to suffer depreciation when once
normal functioning has been interfered
with. So intricate and inter-dependent
are the various parts and functions of
the superior mammal’s body, that it is
hardly possible to disturb the balance of
one part or one function without impairing
the whole. Thus it is not unlikely, in
these latter days when ninety-nine per
cent. of the population of highly civilized
countries is suffering from some kind of
defective function or bodily part, that
all of us are sub-human in spirit as well
as in body. It is even conceivable that
the hopeless pass at which we are arriving
in Western civilization is but the inevitable
outcome of our chronic sub-normality
or sub-humanity, and that nothing but
a reform of our bodies can possibly help
us out.</p>

<p class='c015'>Nor is it any longer valid to argue that
this view is materialistic. We thank Dean
Inge <i>en passant</i> for his able reply to those
who, objecting to the standpoint that has
just been advanced, are ready to accuse
those who hold it of materialism.</p>

<p class='c015'>At all events we can honestly deny that
we are materialists, and do not believe
that we are any the less religious or
spiritual for having fought hard for our
heterodox religious views through years
of metaphysical study and thought.
Secondly, we repudiate the suggestion
that to preach the care and maintenance
of the beauty and health of the body is
necessarily material; for it is the invalid,
the sick man, the man of this age, who
calls himself “well,” who is constantly
reminded of his body. A healthily functioning
body can be forgotten. Thanks
to its serenity, its muteness in efficiency,
it allows its owner to indulge in every
variety of spiritual exercise.</p>

<p class='c015'>While, therefore, we accuse the values
which for centuries have cast a slur on
life and the human body of being the
cause of modern decadence, we do not
thereby proclaim ourselves either irreligious
or materialistic; for, let those who
would too hastily presume both our irreligiosity
and materialism remember that
there are other religions besides that
which first created the body-despising
values to which we allude.</p>

<p class='c015'>And, when we challenge the modern
age to prove that it can be anything else
than materialistic, with its countless
millions of sick or deficient bodies; when
we challenge it to show in what manner
the two thousand years of body-contempt
and body-neglect have led us to a loftier
spirituality, the very grossness of modern
life, the very besottedness of the modern
mind, and the very system of government
in the modern world, <i>Democracy</i>, which
is materialism in politics (estimating the
value of an idea or policy by measuring
the <i>body-weight</i> behind it, not by measuring
the authority, ability, or competence
behind it)—all rise before us in their
ugliness, leaving us but few qualms concerning
the danger that we, of our persuasion,
run, of falling into materialism by
questioning the values that have brought
us thus far.</p>

<p class='c015'>The masses are materialistic to-day because,
in the first place, lowered vitality
and defective functioning depress the
spirit and dull the wits, thus unfitting the
mind for all lofty pursuits; and, secondly,
because at every moment of their lives
their attention is either riveted upon their
own halting functions or else distracted
by similar disturbances in those among
whom their lot is cast.</p>

</div>
<h3 class='c020'>(I) <span class='sc'>The Unmarried</span></h3>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>We</span> have seen that the disillusionment
that dogs the heels of the values directing
our civilization and its alleged progress
consists in our ultimate discovery that
Life, as seen through the optics of our
impaired and science-aided bodies, appears
to have lost a substantial portion of its
reputed value. The <i>joie de vivre</i> becomes
an antiquated myth, no longer a present
experience.</p>
<p class='c015'>If, however, this is true from the standpoint
of modern men, how very much
more true it must be from that of modern
women! For, if it is right to claim that
some of Life’s greatest and most lasting
joys are connected with the maintenance
of the species, woman, whose share in
reproduction is much greater than man’s,
must necessarily be the greater sufferer
when the corporeal equipment of the race
becomes defective.</p>

<p class='c015'>In these degenerate days of fourth-rate
bodily joys, therefore, when the corporeal
equipment of man and woman has to be
scientifically completed with the help of
elaborate extra-corporeal aids, it is among
the women of the species that we should
expect to find the greatest revolt against
the old notions concerning Life, Motherhood,
and Domesticity.</p>

<p class='c015'>For man’s degeneracy in itself contributes
an added woe to woman’s impaired
physical life, by depriving her of
the very extra-corporeal equipment (supplied
by Nature herself in this case) for
the urgent needs of her body. Or, if it
does not altogether deprive her of this
equipment, it gives it to her in a form so
atonic, fireless, and un-ideal that the
misery of modern women, even when they
are married, is very great. Hence, we
believe, the huge development of the
modern novel, the demand for which has
been created almost entirely by the
female population. For only people
whose lives are unsatisfying endeavour
to enjoy life vicariously in the unreal
world of fiction.</p>

<p class='c015'>Perhaps it was the recognition of this
fact, that the value of life for woman
depends to a great extent on her physical
efficiency and health, which led the
ancients to feel so much concern about
the physical condition of their womenfolk,
and this probably explains why such
careful instructions are to be found in
sacred books—like that of Manu, for
instance—regarding a father’s duty towards
his daughters.</p>

<p class='c015'>Manu goes so far as to say: “Reprehensible
is the father who gives not his
daughter in marriage at the proper time.”
And he adds: “To a distinguished handsome
suitor should a father give his
daughter.... But the maiden, though
marriageable, should rather stop in her
father’s house until death than that he
should ever give her to a man destitute of
good qualities.”</p>

<p class='c015'>In <i>Ecclesiasticus</i> we read the following
exhortation to fathers: “Hast thou
daughters? Have a care of their
body.”<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c018'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f3'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r3'>3</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It might be argued against the line taken in
the Introduction that here is an instance of the
care of the body in the literature from which
the body-despising values are alleged to hail.
But this is a misunderstanding. Not only is
<i>Ecclesiasticus</i> apocryphal, but also, as everybody
must know, the Old Testament and the
New are quite different in their attitude towards
the body. In the New Dispensation, and certainly
in traditional Christianity, it is never suggested,
as it is in Judaic law, that a man who is
bodily defective defiles the sanctuary of the
Lord when he approaches it. This healthy attitude
to the body, which constantly recurs in the
Old Testament, can be found neither in the New
Testament nor in historical Christianity.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>And in Aristophanes we find the
following sentiment expressed by a
married woman: “Καὶ Θἠμέτερον μὲν ἐᾶτε;
περὶ των δὲ χορῶν ἐν τοῖς θαλάμοις γηρασχουσῶν
ἀνιῶμαι” (But do not let us complain
about ourselves. What breaks my
heart is the sight of all these young girls
who will grow old sleeping alone.) Aristophanes,
<i>Lysistrata</i>, ll. 592-3.</p>

<p class='c015'>Evidently these exhortations and sentiments
hail from an age preceding that in
which the body-despising values were
created, for they breathe a different atmosphere,
and ring strangely in our ears.</p>

<p class='c015'>As late as the sixteenth century in
England, when, it may be supposed, a
vestige of the old pagan spirit still
lingered among our people, there is
indeed a tender allusion to the female
body; and, strange to say, it occurs in
our <i>Book of Common Prayer</i>. But the
very oddness of the sentiment to our
modern ears shows how completely
foreign it is to the atmosphere created by
our values, and we may be sure that it is
seldom read, or, if read, seldom understood,
at a modern marriage service. It
is as follows:</p>

<p class='c022'>“For the husband is the head of the wife ...
 and he is the Saviour of the body.”</p>

<p class='c023'>We have lost all sympathy with this
attitude. We no longer consider the physical
side of our daughters’ and sisters’
lives. We may wish them to have a “good
time”; or, if we are poor, we wish them
to be self-supporting. But bodily considerations
scarcely enter into the first
wish, and into the second—never!</p>

<p class='c015'>Coupled, however, with our attitude of
callous indifference to the young female’s
body is also the increasing doubt which
is spreading among all classes regarding
the actual value of the normal and natural
life for woman. Impaired physical efficiency
has turned so many of the joys
and beauties of the natural life to pain
and horror that there is no longer that
certainty which Manu felt about the
desirability of motherhood for women.
And, even when motherhood is not regarded
as a greatly over-rated pleasure,
the mates by means of whom motherhood
can be experienced are, as a rule, such
poor shadows of men that the whole of
Manu’s attitude has begun to be discredited.
The Feminist Movement, in
fact, is actively engaged in discrediting it,
and that is why the Feminist Movement
itself may be regarded as a remote off-shoot
of the body-despising values.</p>

<p class='c015'>Indeed, things have come to such a
pass in this country that at present rich
and poor alike are far more concerned
about giving their daughters a calling than
a mate; and, when once this has been
done, it is felt that parents have discharged
their responsibility.</p>

<p class='c015'>The most convincing demonstration of
the prevalence of this attitude was the
uproar that arose a year or two ago,
when one or two imprudent journalists
inadvertently referred to our 2,000,000
excess of women over men as “surplus
women.” The daily press was immediately
flooded by indignant letters from
women of all classes, protesting that, as
a large proportion of these 2,000,000 were
self-supporting and ample room existed
for the remainder in our industries and
professions, it was absurd to speak of
them as “surplus.” Articles soon followed,
in which the same views were
expressed, though possibly more magisterially.
But there was no reference to
the bodily destiny of these 2,000,000
females—not a hint that the word “surplus”
might have some relevancy if they
were looked at in relation to the available
males, or that a civilization which condemns
one-sixth of its adult females to
celibacy must be very wrong!</p>

<p class='c015'>It was for all the world as if being self-supporting
and useful in industry or the
professions were the sole and unique
object of human life, and nobody seemed
to see that, in this case, there was no conceivable
reason why human beings should
have been created or become male and
female. Of course the howl of indignation
that arose at the word “surplus”
was greatest among those women who are
frankly hostile to men, and who are
keenest about making the bodily destiny
of their sex a matter of no consequence.
Nevertheless, the cruelty of the attitude
adopted by all was never actually felt as
cruelty by anyone, because the very
people responsible for those articles and
letters would have been the last to
suspect themselves, or to be suspected by
others, of any trace of inhumanity. All
they wanted to imply, and wished everybody
else to believe, was that a human
life can be full and can be lived adequately
<i>without that</i>!</p>

<p class='c015'>And yet to anyone who reveres the
body, and who knows how the spirit is
tortured by a body unsatisfied and
neglected, how thoroughly unfounded
does this claim appear! A thwarted
instinct does not meekly subside. It
seeks compensation and damages for its
rebuff. True sublimation, except through
whole-hearted and unremitting religious
practices, is rare. What then is the fate
of these 2,000,000 women? Can we
reckon with certainty on their all being so
much below even the common standard
of their married sisters that they will
have no instincts to thwart? There is an
inclination abroad to adopt this comforting
view. So accustomed have we become
to the spectacle of our omnibuses, trams,
and trains being filled each morning with
unmarried female workers, that we are
easily led to the erroneous conclusion that,
as time goes on, these female workers will
grow as used to filling their lives by means
of self-support as we have grown accustomed
to seeing them.</p>

<p class='c015'>And, indeed, there would be something
to be said for this view if, by a kind of
unemotional parthenogenesis, these spinster
workers could breed their own kind,
each generation of whom would be ever
more perfectly adapted. But unfortunately
this cannot be so. People forget
that each generation of them is born
from mothers who, in an uninterrupted
line reaching right back to our anthropoid
ancestors, have filled their lives with
something more than self-support and
business usefulness. Each generation of
these unmated women-workers is born
from mothers who must have known
the ardent embrace of a lover, the
ecstasy of consummated love, and the
clinging devotion of adoring offspring.
No break can have occurred in this long
dynasty of love, otherwise they—the
women-workers themselves—would not
be there. It is impossible at present to
rear a species of human beings to lovelessness
as you can rear a breed of dogs to
retrieving or sheep-minding. Love must
always have existed one step back. And
it is this fact, that these unmated women-workers
are all so fatally close to love, all
such near blood-relations of love, that
makes lovelessness such an ordeal and a
trial to them—an ordeal and a trial no
human being who has not sinned against
society should be made to suffer.</p>

<p class='c015'>Thus the modern world is inclined to be
very cruel to the young unmated woman.
For, while everything is done to facilitate
her self-support and usefulness, no provision
is made either to ensure the
sublimation of her mating instincts (a
problem of almost insuperable difficulty
now, though solved with success in the
Middle Ages), or to give her the chance
of expressing them without dishonour
and disgrace. On the contrary, the whole
tendency is to ignore, to shelve, and to
conceal that aspect of her life; and
thousands of bitter or sub-normal women,
whose thwarted or deficient passions have
unsaddled their natural love of man, are
now only too eager to assure her and
everybody else that human beings can
well get on and be happy without sexual
expression—in fact that a spirit and a
body can quite easily play the life-long
rôle of a disembodied spirit.</p>

<p class='c015'>All this does not mean that the solution
of the unmated woman problem is an
easy and obvious one, which modern
people are too blind to see. But it does
mean that the very first step towards its
proper solution can never be taken as
long as we persist in arguing and behaving
as if a full life can be lived by merely
paying one’s way.</p>

<p class='c015'>In 1921 the population of England and
Wales amounted to 37,885,242 persons,
of whom 19,803,022 were females. Of
this female population 4,302,568 consisted
of children under twelve, and the
remainder, amounting to 15,501,454, were
divided up as follows:</p>

<p class='c015'>9,070,538 were married or widowed or
divorced, and 6,403,916 were single. Of
the married 1,106,433, and of the single
4,000,000 (to be precise, 3,914,127) were
occupied in some form of work, thus
making a total of 5,020,560 women-workers,
3,000,000 of whom were employed
in industry alone.</p>

<p class='c015'>These figures give some idea of the
formidable development of women’s employment
within recent years, nor is there
any sign whatsoever that the movement
is likely to abate. Those who are aware of
the harm that modern industry and commercial
offices have done to the spirit and
bodies of men for generations, by converting
them into little more than machine-minders
or adding-machines, exercising
few if any of their highest faculties, may
deplore the fact that the sex which hitherto
had still to a large extent escaped these
dehumanizing labours should now be
enrolled in such large numbers to accomplish
them. The last check on the complete
besotment of our people seems thus
to have vanished. But, in view of the
existing atmosphere and tendencies, there
seems to be little hope of a reaction.</p>

<p class='c015'>The 4,000,000 spinster workers alone
represent a formidable army; and, when
it is remembered that this vast legion of
single women not only compete with and
directly replace male labour, thus reducing
still more their chances of marriage,
but are also drawn away from home and
from the many arts that could be learnt
there, we cannot help feeling alarmed at
the possible consequences of the development
we are witnessing.</p>

<p class='c015'>The duties and virtues of the home are
almost all connected with the body and
its care—sewing, cooking, and the nurture
of the young. All these arts are gradually
being lost; and, when they have to
be performed by inexperienced hands,
they are performed badly.</p>

<p class='c015'>Meanwhile, abetting this movement
and rendering it ever more practicable,
there are hundreds and thousands of
commercial and voluntary corporations
whose whole energies are directed towards
taking the home-arts out of the hands of
women. Science, as usual, following the
hints implicit in values, has come to the
assistance of our female population deficient
in domestic skill and knowledge.
The art of cooking is gradually becoming
simplified into a mere fool’s game, and
in its place we are being deluged by
innumerable patent and proprietary products,
the preparation of which requires
no thought and no trouble. These products
are very largely injurious to the
bodies of those who live on them, but, as
they leave the housewife ample leisure to
gad about or else to earn money outside
the home, no one complains. Quick gravy-makers,
pudding- and cake-powders,
tinned foods of every description all ready
for consumption, custards, porridges, and
jellies that require only a few minutes’
cooking, jams and preserves, and a multitude
of other artificial aids to replace,
though not to equal, the dishes of former
days, now compose the normal contents of
almost every working-class and middle-class
market-bag. Never have the country’s
food and its preparation been in a
more deplorable condition than they are
to-day. Nevertheless, so strong is the
tradition to neglect bodily concerns, that
all this vast machinery for supplementing
traditional knowledge, skill, labour, and
good food, in the home, has grown up in
our midst without a word of protest from
anyone.</p>

<p class='c015'>As regards the lot of infants and
children, so completely broken is the
tradition which, once upon a time, was
handed down from mother to daughter,
that now child-welfare-workers in every
town in England, equipped with but a
smattering of sound knowledge on the
subject, have to teach the women of the
masses the arts they have had no opportunity
of acquiring. In the departments
of dress-making, millinery, and lingerie, it
is just the same. Together with the loss of
skill and knowledge in the home, the supply
of ready-mades from outside increases
with leaps and bounds, and huge drapery-businesses,
carried on in palatial premises,
now line all our leading thoroughfares in
a practically unbroken frontage.</p>

<p class='c015'>Thus, even if the girls and young
women of the nation who are or who are
not eligible for marriage were to remain
at home, there would now be little for
them to learn, and still less for them to
do; and the recent Girl Guide Movement
is the best possible proof that this fact
has already been recognized.</p>

<p class='c015'>Meanwhile, it may be asked what it is
that these 4,000,000 learn away from
their homes. What do they acquire in
exchange for their lost arts?</p>

<p class='c015'>Those who have not actually adopted
dress-making, millinery, or lingerie as an
occupation, have, as a rule, acquired only
the knowledge necessary for running a
certain machine—a cutter, a folder, a
binder, a stamper, or a typewriter, etc.
Or else they have learnt to wait in
restaurants, sell goods across a counter,
or keep books. Only about one million
of them are either domestic servants or
hospital nurses.</p>

<p class='c015'>Those engaged in industry or commerce
who remain at their work and do not
marry are at least prevented from passing
on their acquired besotment to the next
generation; but, meantime, no one inquires
about their bodies, and the general
feeling is that a girl withered and broken
by long years of typing is not a tragic
figure because in the first place her career
has been morally unimpeachable, and secondly
it has brought neither herself nor
anyone else any pleasure.</p>

<p class='c015'>In the better classes, teaching and the
professions obtain the bulk of the recruits
each year,<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c018'><sup>[4]</sup></a> and girls are now trained
quite unselectively from earliest childhood
with a view to entering these occupations,
as if it were taken for granted that they
would never marry.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r4'>4</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In 1923 in England and Wales there were

and 2,000 doctors; and, in 1921, 93,987 elementary
and secondary school-teachers.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>Not all of the 6,403,916 spinsters—whether
workers or not—are doomed to
spinsterhood. As we have seen, the
excess of females over males in England
and Wales is only 1,720,902.<a id='r5' /><a href='#f5' class='c018'><sup>[5]</sup></a> But unless
they attempt to emigrate, these odd
2,000,000 must certainly remain unmated,
and even if emigration could now
be organized on a much bigger scale than
hitherto, they could hardly be satisfactorily
disposed of.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f5'>

greater, owing first to the cases of celibacy
among the available men and secondly to the
marriage of widows.</p>

if they could, it is doubtful whether such

</div>

<p class='c015'>Owing to the degeneracy and unattractiveness
of modern man, a certain noble
and estimable proportion of these
6,000,000 will of course refrain from any
attempt at marriage. Still faithful to the
lost and antiquated values that once led
people to respect and care for their bodies,
they will feel secretly that their bodies
deserve something better than the mate
the twentieth century can offer them;
and, although they may be fully and
admirably equipped for happy motherhood,
this noble and very small minority
will turn nauseated away from it in
order to become absorbed in interests
that will help them to forget. These are
the greatest sufferers among modern
women, and their unmated condition
constitutes our greatest national loss.</p>

<p class='c015'>But the great majority will be too
thoroughly unsophisticated, too completely
immersed in the values of their
day, to see anything wrong or odd in
degeneration. These, like the 9,000,000
already mated, will strive after marriage
and the home. They will insist on having
their third-rate or fourth-rate bodily
ecstasies with the inferior men of the age,
and on rearing their fourth-rate children.
And, if their hopes are disappointed,
either through their inability to find a
mate or owing to the rude awakening that
too often comes with modern matrimony,
they will become either wretched spinsters
or disgruntled wives. We shall consider
their fate as wives, however, in the next
chapter.</p>

<p class='c015'>There are also a large number whose
bodies are so conspicuously inferior in
passion and equipment that they will be
indifferent to marriage through sheer
physiological apathy. Looking at life
through the optics of their atonic or
badly functioning bodies, they will declare
love unnecessary to human well-being,
and the natural life a wholly antiquated
desideratum. They will lack the desire
even for fourth-rate bodily experiences,
and scorn all such experiences in consequence.
They will boast that they are
“above sex.” To them the Feminist
reformers will point triumphantly in
refutation of all the arguments of those
who, like ourselves, claim that sound and
desirable women cannot be happy unmated.
And the more simple and unsuspecting
among mankind, looking upon
these adapted unmated women, will begin
to believe that the Feminists are right.
As the number of these women increases
every year, and, in their systematic
depreciation of the value of life, they are
joined and supported by thousands of
disillusioned married women who also
have become slanderers of love and man,
the ranks of those who scoff at marriage
and motherhood as the only satisfactory
calling for women, swell with imposing
rapidity.</p>

<p class='c015'>With two million spinsters, and—if we
reckon the disgruntled married women—with
probably two or three million more
women distributed all over England, who
are prepared to malign both man and life
and to cause the effect of their thwarted
impulses to be felt in a thousand ways,
a good deal of misery and friction must
necessarily arise from modern conditions
which it is extremely difficult to relieve.</p>

<p class='c015'>But the most serious aspect of the
spinster and embittered wife question,
from the standpoint of the nation’s life,
is the compensation which, consciously or
unconsciously, these unmated women and
revolted wives, particularly the wealthy
and leisured ones, seek for their thwarted
instincts. The mother’s fostering care
never having been experienced, its joys
and thrills are sought along other channels.
The lust of exercising power becomes a
consuming passion, and its owner is
usually quite indifferent as to the means
she uses to express it. Any movement,
any policy, any kind of interference may
supply the opportunity, and the merits
of the case will always be subordinate to
the urgent need of alleviating the hunger
for compensatory power. Thus influences
and forces are let loose which have about
as much wisdom in them as accident
alone can be expected to introduce into
any lustful action; and, all the while,
the loftiest motives will be professed for
the activities pursued. The very natural
discontent which arises from thwarted
instincts will also tend to express itself in
many instances, particularly among the
disillusioned married, as a bitter hatred
of man; and, as I shall show later, in its
extreme form as an unconscious jealousy
of healthy young women and happily
married women. This will lead to an
attempt to wean the latter from the lure
of love and men. Signs are already visible
which show that such a movement is on
foot, and, although these Lysistratas of
the modern world have not Lysistrata’s
patriotic motives, this will not make them
any the less anxious to achieve their end.</p>

<p class='c015'>At all events, from the imperfectly concealed
triumph with which such people,
particularly the female working-woman
leaders, will tell you that in 1923 700,000
of the 5,020,560 women-workers were
<i>directly replacing males</i> in industry alone,
it is impossible not to read the signs of
hostility to the male in their general outlook;
and, to examine their literature, is
to become convinced of it, careful as they
are to cover it up.</p>

<p class='c015'>Among the organizers of women-movements
to-day, there can be no question
that there is this note of hostility to the
male; and the reason of it is that women-movements
are largely led either by
spinsters or else by unhappy married
women.</p>

<p class='c015'>Now the attitude of Feminism towards
our vast army of spinsters and disgruntled
wives is that of Socialist organizations
all over the world towards discontented
labour elements. It is one in
which the latent discontent is turned to
every possible advantage for the Cause.
Feminism offers no bodily solution of
the problem presented by our unmated
women and our disillusioned wives, and
it escapes from the responsibility of so
doing by consistently regarding the whole
crowd as nothing more than disembodied
spirits. It does not even recognize that
the muddle in which we now find ourselves
is chiefly due to physical degeneration:
for that it is too Puritanical. All
it does is to promote and intensify the
very tendencies which have brought us
to our present pass, and to use the power
obtained from its supporters to express
in every possible way, legislatively and
otherwise, its general hostility to man
and its radical hatred of the bodily side
of life.</p>

<p class='c015'>Meanwhile, it misses no opportunity of
appealing to the vanity and mistaken
ambition of its potential victims, in
order to lure even the normal and
desirable among modern young women in
ever greater numbers into neutral pursuits
and interests only fit for neuters.
And it sets to work with a conscience so
clean, with such a profound conviction
of its rectitude, and above all with such
a great display of moral indignation, that
the more guileless sections of the modern
world, always taken in by moral indignation,
are almost led to believe that
Feminism is a natural and desirable
evolutionary development, on which all
hope for the future depends.</p>

<p class='c015'>Why does Feminism act with a conscience
so clean and a conviction so profound
of its rectitude?—Because, behind
it, it feels the support of the body-despising
values, which tell it that
Puritanism is right, that sex-equality is
at last a fact owing to the marked degeneration
of man, and that man, as the
traditional enemy of female “virtue,” is
<i>the</i> enemy <i>par excellence</i>.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c013'>CHAPTER II<br /> <br /><span class='sc'>The Present Position of Women</span></h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c020'>(II) <span class='sc'>The Married</span></h3>
<p class='c021'><span class='sc'>We</span> shall now examine a little more
closely the lot of the 9,000,000 odd women
in England and Wales who are or who
have been married, and endeavour to find
out whether similar tendencies to those
already discovered in the previous chapter
are making their influence felt in the
matrimonial life of the country.</p>
<p class='c015'>Attention has already been called to
the fact that, almost as fast as bodily
parts or functions are lost, science comes
forward with aids that enable us to carry
on notwithstanding; and also that these
substitutes, combined with the third-rate
bodily experiences secured by our impaired
physique, make us question the
value of both life and love.</p>

<p class='c015'>Nowhere, however, are the effects of
imperfect functioning or incomplete
bodies more acutely felt than in the
married state; and that is why, if
science had recognized the importance of
securing happiness for this state, it would
have left no stone unturned in order to
restore to us the natural conditions on
which happiness depends, instead of
giving us ever more and more efficient
substitutes.</p>

<p class='c015'>In our present world the effect of the
body-despising values enters as a disturber
of our bliss into almost every
aspect of matrimony.</p>

<p class='c015'>It enters first in the form of our impaired
physiques, and affects the female
partner in two ways: it depreciates the
quality of her most important <i>natural</i>
extra-corporeal equipment, <i>man</i>, and
therefore the quality of her joy; and it
further depreciates that joy through her
own indifferent bodily condition.</p>

<p class='c015'>It enters next in the form of Puritanism,
which, thanks to its associated fear of,
and incompetence in, sexual matters,
arrests the male partner’s impulses,
causing him to hesitate, flounder, and
frequently to fail, whereby the ideal
relationship of two ardent lovers is
marred, if not destroyed; and it usually
succeeds in preventing them from attaining
the top wave of ecstasy by imposing
inhibitions against perfectly instinctive
desires.</p>

<p class='c015'>Finally, it enters by rendering ever
more and more harassing for the woman
the natural consequences of conjugal
intimacy—gestation, parturition, and
lactation; and by converting these once
beautiful and enthralling functions into
things of ugliness and pain.</p>

<p class='c015'>We cannot here discuss the many ways
in which our bodily disorders and defects
interfere with the happy congress of man
and wife. Suffice it to say, however, that
science already gives a good deal of
assistance even here, and is likely to
perform a good deal more.</p>

<p class='c015'>At all events, this much we may say
without impropriety—that, as fast as
Puritanism and bodily imperfections together
have conspired to cast a slur on
sex by converting the congress of the
human couple from an experience of
magic beauty into an ordeal of both
painful embarrassment and actual pain,
not only have a certain number of women
begun to think that conception without
congress would be a god-send, but a
scientific technique, which realizes this
desideratum, has also been brought to
ever greater efficiency. Artificial impregnation—the
scientific aid again!—is
now a thoroughly familiar operation,
frequently performed; and, if the present
tendencies continue, and the body-despising
values culminate in their extreme
logical consequence—the elimination
of the body—there can be no doubt
that it will become ever more and more
customary.</p>

<p class='c015'>In the limited space at our disposal,
however, we must concentrate upon
gestation, parturition, and lactation in
this chapter, more particularly as they
form so important a part of woman’s
share in married life.</p>

<p class='c015'>Now it may be stated straight away
that there are no human functions that
have got into a more alarming state of
abnormality and muddle than gestation,
parturition, and lactation. Indeed, so
great are the divergences from Nature in
the two latter functions, that it is no
exaggeration to say that, all hope of ever
recovering normal conditions having long
since been abandoned, all persons have
now resigned themselves to an almost
complete reliance on artificial aids. In
the middle and so-called “upper” classes
instruments and anæsthetics are now very
nearly the rule in helping the function of
parturition, while among the poorer
classes they are very common. And in
regard to lactation, all kinds of unnatural
food, including, of course, cow’s milk,
take the place of breast-feeding.</p>

<p class='c015'>The doctors, the nurses, the mothers,
and the whole population have, we
declare, resigned themselves to the
modern conditions of difficult and
scientifically aided childbirth; but it
would be more strictly accurate to say
that they have meekly prostrated themselves
before a <i>fait accompli</i>; for, as far
as we have been able to judge, no
attempt on a grand scale has ever yet
been made to ascertain whether the
present difficulties are as hopelessly inevitable
as they seem, or whether a more
normal method of functioning might not
be recovered.</p>

<p class='c015'>The ugly circumstances of modern
childbirth, mitigated to some extent only
by a liberal use of anæsthetics, are now
sufficient to intimidate any young woman
who happens to reflect, before marriage,
on her future prospects; while to those
already married they constitute a heavy
lowering cloud, which hardly ever disperses
until the climacteric at last puts an
end to all anxiety. Stated in the most
moderate terms, these ugly circumstances
at least add to the arguments which, in
our Puritanical and Feminist atmosphere,
accumulate year by year against both the
body and the sexual life; and for this
reason alone, if for no other, it is important
for us to examine them and to
see how, or whether, they can be mitigated.</p>

<p class='c015'>The curious part of it is that, here, we
are not confronted by degeneration or
malformation nearly to the extent that
some people suppose; but by ignorance,
lack of initiative in the medical profession,
and the foolish superstitions of all
the chief actors in the muddle—the
expectant mothers, the doctors, and the
nurses.</p>

<p class='c015'>A certain percentage of births still
takes place each year under normal conditions—that
is to say, without anæsthetics
or instruments; but even of these
it is safe to say that they are accompanied
by much more pain than can
possibly be natural; while, owing to
circumstances quite independent of the
mother’s bodily condition, even these
cases often receive quite unnecessary
scientific aid.</p>

<p class='c015'>The circumstances that cause doctors
to interfere more and more frequently
with confinements that promise to be
normal are the following: In the well-to-do
classes, <i>the extreme busyness of the
doctor</i>, on the one hand, <i>which makes him
disinclined to wait for Nature to do her
work</i>; and, on the other, his interested
relationship to his patient, which
makes it almost necessary for him to
appear as her champion. By encouraging
the patient to be put to sleep
and to allow the process to be hurried,
the doctor thus kills two birds with one
stone. After only a few hours’ labour,
therefore, he will employ anæsthetics,
and the result is that what might have
been a fairly normal confinement, free
from anæsthesia and instruments, becomes
a serious operation, in which damage
is frequently inflicted on the young
mother.</p>

<p class='c015'>In the poorer classes the same thing
happens, except that poor women often
go to some public institution to be confined.
It should not be forgotten, however,
that young and aspiring doctors
have to acquire some practice with the
obstetric forceps, and that it is precisely
in homes and hospitals that this practice
can be obtained. Instead of its being the
excessive busyness of the doctor that leads
to the hasty and unnecessary use of
instruments, therefore, it is now the
circumstance that the woman may find
herself in a maternity-home or hospital.
And the tragic part of it is that the
demonstrating surgeon in such cases, far
from electing an abnormal pregnancy for
his exhibition, deliberately chooses the
most normal of his patients, because of
the greater ease with which the demonstration
can then be made. Thus, even
when Nature is most willing and modern
women are most normal, natural functioning
is spurned and rebuffed. Such cases,
however, are possible only in an atmosphere
that has long been infected with
body-despising prejudices. In no other
atmosphere would the doctors dare to
behave in this way.</p>

<p class='c015'>At all events, among both the rich
and the poor, normal confinements are
becoming increasingly rare, and we shall
now try to discover why, except in case
of obvious abnormality, this is so; and
why, moreover, even in normal confinements
there is always, or almost always,
the alleged “sorrow” or excessive pain
of biblical tradition.</p>

<p class='c015'>Provisionally we suggest the following
reasons for the difficulties of parturition
among modern women, and for the fact
that nothing is done to restore more
normal functioning:</p>

<p class='c015'>(<b>a</b>) <i>The absurd superstition that our
heads are getting larger and that the
pelves of women are getting smaller.</i>
Doctors are persuaded that the difficulty
of modern childbirth must be due to
“Progress.” And, since “Progress” is
erroneously connected in their own and
most people’s minds with the belief that
men are growing more intelligent (which
quite obviously they are not), the facile
conclusion is reached that, as our brains
must be growing larger, our heads must
follow suit. It is hardly necessary to
say that this is sheer nonsense, and no
more than an indolent excuse for the
Conservative stagnation of the medical
brotherhood. The heads of modern
people are certainly not larger than the
heads of their ancestors ten thousand
years ago (<i>vide</i> Keith’s <i>Antiquity of</i>
<i>Man</i>); and as to the shrinking of
women’s hips, this also is an invention.
It is certainly found, but only where the
pelvis is rachitic, or where undue strains
on the thighs in early childhood (in
violent games, etc.) have led to a premature
stiffening of the fleshy, and a
premature ossification of the bony, parts.
At all events, it is much less common than
is usually supposed; and, in any case, it
is very seldom that there is any disproportion
between the sizes of the foetus
and the pelvis. See, however, how convenient
the explanation is—Increasing
brains, larger heads, and shrinking
pelves!—The doctors, shrugging their
shoulders before this apparently vicious
circle, can quietly resign themselves, <i>à la</i>
Walrus and Carpenter, to a permanent
engagement as artificial functionaries to
supersede a perfectly natural human function;
and, what is more, they need feel
no dread about growing thinner or poorer
themselves as time goes on, nor trouble
to discover how normal functioning can
be recovered.</p>

<p class='c015'>(<b>b</b>) <i>The still more absurd superstition
that a baby should be 8 or 9 lbs at birth.</i>
This is universal in England, and whether
it is the daily newspapers over the birth
of a prince, or a poor woman’s neighbours
over the birth of a new pauper, everybody
is jubilant if an 8-lb baby is born. It
may have required a team from Harley
Street to deliver it, and it may, and
usually does, lose weight after birth;
but all this does not matter: nobody
cares, nobody troubles to think, provided
that it has registered the full 8 lbs in the
first hour of its existence. Unfortunate
women, permanently injured by instruments,
smile triumphantly over the
thought that they have had a baby-boy
weighing 9 lbs. But what can we expect
when their doctors encourage them in
these lunatic transports?</p>

<p class='c015'>(<b>c</b>) <i>The belief, deeply rooted in the
modern and lay minds, that it is God’s
decree that children should be brought
forth in sorrow.</i> Having rejected the
<i>Genesis</i> version of the origin of man and
all living creatures, it is remarkable that
the modern world, led by its men of
science, should take so seriously a curse
mentioned in the first book of Moses,
which, even if its effect be admitted as
possible, had probably only a tribal or
national application when it was uttered.
And it is still more odd that they should
regard us and our womenfolk as still
lying under its spell. For, apart from
the fact that there are savage and semi-civilized
tribes still in existence with
whom childbirth is not nearly such a
sorrowful event as some might suppose,
but a simple and easy function (<i>teste</i>
almost every ethnological work), why
should we assume that the Jewish
women, to whom the curse originally
applied, were normal or lived normally?
From our knowledge of the Syrian Jewess,
it seems highly probable that, if her
remote ancestors resembled her, their confinements
must have been extremely
sorrowful. But what has that to do with
us? This never seems to have occurred
to the modern medical man; and, taking
the <i>Genesis</i> curse as his motto, he has
now solemnly allowed the agony to be
piled up, till it is no longer merely in
sorrow, but almost in tragedy, that
children are brought forth—not to mention
the extra-corporeal equipment of
instruments, etc. And, why should there
be any limit? When once the principle
is admitted, where is the line to be drawn,
particularly if it pays not to draw it?
We protest, however, that even if we
admit—which we do not—that there
must be “sorrow,” this can hardly have
meant the miserable failure and elaborate
scientific technique which modern medicine
has made of parturition in general.</p>

<p class='c015'>Now, in view of these three articles of
faith, not only are the doctors and the
public in an attitude that paralyses all
endeavour to effect a change for the
better, but both the doctors and the
public have ceased to ask whether any
such change is possible. Having ceased
to ask the question, no effort is made to
inquire into the means of achieving the
end it suggests; and, as usual, everything
is staked on artificial aids. Anyone
who, like ourselves, asks whether there
are not other ways of overcoming the
enormous difficulties of parturition
among modern women, in order to
remove this cloud from life and love
and restore pleasure to a natural function,
is laughed at.</p>

<p class='c015'>Nevertheless the present writer continues
to ask the question, and for the
following reasons:</p>

<p class='c015'>For a long time it has seemed to him
suspicious that Nature, who is so uniform
in her methods and who with such unfailing
consistency has made all vital
functions pleasant, should have made
this one conspicuous exception, particularly
in regard to a function linked to the
most vital moment in our lives. Being
unsatisfied with the verdict of science on
the subject, therefore, he made inquiries
on his own account, and was not at all
surprised to find, not only that a number
of existing races still enjoy infinitely
greater ease in parturition than most
European women, but also that, as he
expected, there are still to be found
among mankind faint vestiges of that
ecstasy which he believes must once
have attended the function in normal
circumstances. Even the dreams of
some European women lead the inquirer
to suspect the existence of this ecstasy
not so very far back along the racial line.
When, however, the present writer expressed
this view in a recent work dealing
with the subject,<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c018'><sup>[8]</sup></a> he provoked the most
violent indignation, particularly among
women themselves.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r8'>8</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>See <i>Woman: A Vindication</i> (Constable
and Co.: 1923).</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>After having made a number of
observations and experiments on the
higher animals, he discovered not only
that parturition is in fact ecstatic among
these animals when in their natural condition,
but also that their ecstasy can
quickly be altered to anguish by only the
smallest divergence from the normal in
their food during gestation.</p>

<p class='c015'>Observing animals in a state of nature,
moreover, he arrived at this interesting
conclusion, <i>that their young</i>, even when
the mothers are in splendid fettle, <i>are
only skin and bone at birth</i>, that their
birth is an ecstatic function to the mother
only when they are in this state, and that
young born in this way not only never
lose weight, but grow as plump and vigorous
as could be wished in the first
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p class='c015'>If, however, the gestating mother’s
food be so modified <i>as to make it unlike
the natural food of the species</i>—for instance,
if large quantities of potatoes,
bread, cabbage, and rice-pudding be
given to a female cat, with rations
of cooked instead of raw meat—the
birth of the kittens, which are grossly
fat, is immensely difficult, and some
of them may be still-born or appear
only after long delay in mutilated
fragments.</p>

<p class='c015'>The present writer has confirmed these
facts repeatedly, and they led him to ask
this question: <i>whether civilized women,
even in antiquity, have not habitually
taken the wrong food during gestation,
with the result that their babies have
been too fat or too hard in the bone at
birth</i>?</p>

<p class='c015'>It is notorious that a small, healthy
6-lb baby frequently flourishes better
than the heavier infant of 8 or 9 lbs;
also that, since the larger baby usually
loses weight after birth, its bulk is
demonstrably unnecessary at that stage.
What then prevents us from adopting
what is obviously Nature’s plan—the
birth of relatively thin and small babies,
through care of the gestating mother’s
food?</p>

<p class='c015'>It is obviously only a question of
feeding and hygiene, and of ridding the
public and the medical profession of a
number of absurd prejudices: the rest
will necessarily follow if only it be earnestly
desired.<a id='r9' /><a href='#f9' class='c018'><sup>[9]</sup></a></p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f9'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r9'>9</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As the present chapter is being written, we
notice with pleasure that at a conclave of doctors
held recently at Bradford, Dr Μ. E. Mackenzie,
of Leeds, put a question to the meeting
which showed that she is evidently on the track
of the reforms we recommend; but we were not
surprised to find that the President, Dr J. S.
Fairbairn, declared that he did not take her
remarks seriously. (See <i>British Medical Journal</i>,
Aug. 16th, 1924).</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>We feel convinced, from our study of
animals, that this is the direction in which
inquiry should be directed, for at least
it offers some hope of an improvement,
whereas the elaboration and more persistent
use of artificial aids offers none.
Doctors should exert themselves to discover
that ideal gestatory diet which will
lead to an infant’s being born whose
weight is from 6 to 6½ lbs, whose body
is lean, whose head is small and not too
hard, and who will gain and not lose
weight after birth. But we can hardly
refrain from adding that, when once
these food-conditions are found, medical
men are likely to discover that they have
much less to do than at present by the
bedside of the expectant mother, and that
they will then be invited to delegate their
duties to someone less learned, less expensive,
less pressed for time, and therefore
less interested in achieving the result
by scientific aids.</p>

<p class='c015'>Dr Eichholz of Kreuznach, writing in
the <i>Frauenarzt</i> as early as 1895, outlined
a system of dieting which he declared
produced the results described above;
while Dr Lahmann, who was the first to
point out that our aim should be to obtain
smaller and thinner babies, with heads less
hard at birth, experimented with a diet
poor in nitrogen, which he declared was
completely successful.</p>

<p class='c015'>According to Lahmann, it is not only
excessive feeding and drinking during
pregnancy which, owing to the natural
greed of women and the sycophantic
encouragement of that greed by ignorant
doctors, is the universal error, but the
excessive eating of foods rich in protein;
and he recommends a diet rich in food-salts
and poor in meat and cereals, which
seems to approximate very well to what
one may imagine the food of primitive
mankind to have been.</p>

<p class='c015'>The compass of this work, however,
does not allow us to enter into the
minutiæ of the Lahmann diet. All we
wish to emphasize here is that, if only
we can rid our minds of a few ridiculous
superstitions and aim at a natural ideal,
the attainment of which cannot be beyond
the wit of man, the probability is that
the “sorrow” in which children are
brought forth will be greatly mitigated,
if not wholly removed, and much of its
pristine bliss restored to the life of woman
and to motherhood.</p>

<p class='c015'>Since our aim should be the recovery
of our belief in the value of life and love,
by improving our bodily functions, we
cannot halt at any difficulty in the way
of our success. But success means not
only contesting the sway of the body-despising
values, but also fighting the
Conservatism and prejudices of a great
profession, which, while it has great
power to-day, can hardly fail to identify
its best interests with a perpetuation and
aggravation of our present physical disabilities.</p>

<p class='c015'>Passing now to lactation, which constitutes
one of the chief joys of motherhood,
and which, in its serenity and bliss has
in all ages symbolized the beauty of the
feminine virtues, the home, and the
family, it will perhaps not astonish the
reader to hear that there is at present no
human function, except parturition, which
is more often replaced by artificial means
than this one.</p>

<p class='c015'>The vast multiplication in recent years
of patent infant-foods and preparations
of cow’s milk sufficiently demonstrates the
extent to which modern women are failing
in this respect; and, when it is remembered
that this failure is to be observed in
all classes, even among those who cannot
plead society obligations as an excuse,
the situation appears to be deplorable
enough.</p>

<p class='c015'>No doubt a certain percentage of this
increase in artificial feeding is due to
actual physiological defects; but we must
not make too much of that. Truth to
tell, degeneration and defective functioning
account for but a trifling number of
those who, every year, have recourse to
the bottle instead of the breast in the
feeding of their infants. For, with few
exceptions, lactation can be established
in every woman.</p>

<p class='c015'>The general authoritative opinion seems
to be that “when care is exercised and
adequate attention paid to the necessary
details, the glands can in nearly all cases
be brought into the required degree of
activity,” and that “if the value of natural
feeding were realized, it can hardly be
doubted that the capacity for breast-feeding
would be found to be practically
universal among the women of England.”
(Dr Janet E. Lane Claypon).</p>

<p class='c015'>The enormous popularity of artificial
feeding, therefore, must be due to the
increased activities of women of all
classes outside the home, which is one of
the most noticeable features of the
Women’s Movement, and the consequent
disinclination on their part to undertake
the rearing of their children in the
natural manner. Together with the
decline in the function on the one hand,
and women’s refusal to suckle on the
other, there has, as usual, arisen both a
scientific technique and a host of substitutes
which take the place of mother’s
milk; and, in accordance with our
traditional tendencies, we have once more
neglected the effort to restore natural
conditions, in order to apply all our
ingenuity to the task of bringing artificial
aids to perfection.</p>

<p class='c015'>Now this would be all very well, and
no one could rightly complain, if the
substitutes in this case were more akin to
natural conditions than are most artificial
aids. If this were so we might regret,
from the sentimental and the æsthetic
standpoints, the evanescence of breast-feeding,
and sympathize <i>en passant</i> with
the mothers who were deprived of it as
an experience; but we should be able to
advance no practical reasons why it was
to be deplored from the standpoint of
human desirability.</p>

<p class='c015'>And, indeed, for many years this has
been the position. Although doctors and
commercial corporations repeatedly protest
that breast-feeding is best, they are
quite ready in the same breath to admit
that artificial feeding can be made “as
good as mother’s milk”; and no one is
in the least perturbed when he hears that
his own child or that millions of other
babies are being hand-fed. We have even
read the work of one English doctor who
smugly proclaims that we shall improve
on Nature in this matter!</p>

<p class='c015'>Thus, once again, while flagrant abnormalities
are becoming the rule amongst
us, science hastens to set our minds at
rest by a shower of artificial aids; and,
since we can “carry on,” nothing more
is said.</p>

<p class='c015'>The problem appears to be a simple
one, and, to give scientists their due,
they have done little to complicate it.
Mother’s milk contains so much water,
so much protein, carbo-hydrates, fat, and
mineral salts, and, when once you have
these ingredients in the proper proportions,
you have a synthetic product “as
good as mother’s milk.” Indeed, so long
have these ingredients and their quantitative
values held the field, to the exclusion
of everything else, that we have come
to believe that cow’s milk or even
Allenbury’s is as normal as breast-feeding.</p>

<p class='c015'>And yet, if we were to undergo a
strange and uncommon test hardly ever
applied in highly civilized countries, how
quickly would our blind faith in even the
best artificial methods receive a shock!
True, sentiment alone would be responsible
for the commotion; but in this case
sentiment would be strangely akin to true
knowledge.</p>

<p class='c015'>Place a human baby at the dug of a
cow, a goat, or an ass, as you sometimes
see them placed in semi-civilized countries,
and what is it that you immediately
feel? The sight is an offence to the
eyes, a humiliation of our racial pride.—Why?</p>

<p class='c015'>Instinctively we feel and intellectually
we know that Nature makes the wisest
provision for her needs. When, therefore,
we see one of our babies at the dugs
of a goat, our sense of fitness is shocked:
even our practical utilitarian prejudices
receive a blow. We know instantly that
the baby cannot have been meant to take
that milk, because it is a nobler creature
than the goat and its body has tasks and
feats to perform with its food which the
kid has not. Above all, it has that huge
brain to develop, which the kid has not.
Can it be possible that Nature could have
overlooked that? The human brain is
not only larger at birth than that of
any other animal, but its rate of growth is
also greater. Is it conceivable that Nature
could have made no special provision for
that?</p>

<p class='c015'>Hence our sense of degradation and
revolt—feelings which somehow are not
provoked when the milk reaches us in a
bright glass-bottle, or in a nice clean tin
covered with printed matter—because all
the degrading side of it is then hidden
from our view.</p>

<p class='c015'>The strange part of it, however, is that
this sense of degradation and revolt is
based upon fact; for not only on
<i>a priori</i> grounds may we deny that goat’s
milk or any other substitute can adequately
replace breast-feeding, but we
may also deny it from positive knowledge.</p>

<p class='c015'>Years ago Dr Biedert showed that the
most important differences between
human and cow’s milk were qualitative
rather than quantitative. A little later
Dr G. von Bunge confirmed this view;
and Dr Halliburton, the great physiologist,
has recently repeated and emphasized
it. It is impossible to enter here
into the qualitative differences to which
these authorities refer: suffice it to say
that the gravity of the whole question
from our standpoint lies not merely in the
greater digestibility of human milk, but
in the conspicuous difference between
human milk and all other substitutes
as a brain-developing food. Dr von
Bunge, who calls attention to this
point, claims not only that human milk
is more complex than its substitutes, but
that in it we find lecithin bodies in
peculiar proportions, which serve for the
construction of the inordinately large
human brain.</p>

<p class='c015'>It is not surprising that this important
point should have been overlooked all
this time. As we have already said,
materialism is necessarily the creed of
body-despisers. But, if Dr von Bunge’s
view is correct, how severe must have
been our loss in intelligence and genius,
precisely owing to the decline in breast-feeding!
Certainly the uncontrollable
and increasing stupidity of our governing
classes for over a hundred years, seems to
point to the truth of von Bunge’s views;
for it is among them that, for social
reasons, artificial feeding has been, and
still is, most common. Dean Inge comments
somewhere on the increasing besottedness
of modern people, and we
entirely agree with his view; but we
wonder whether it has ever struck him
that the decline in breast-feeding, which
is the outcome of his body-despising
values, may be one of the most powerful
contributory causes of it.</p>

<p class='c015'>For we should always bear in mind, in
comparing our poor spiritual achievements
with the genial performances of
antiquity, the Middle Ages, the Renaissance,
and the pre-Victorian era, that the
artificial feeding of infants is essentially
a modern invention, and that it was
unknown to antiquity.</p>

<p class='c015'>From Plato down to Pope Alexander
VI no one had ever heard of a baby’s
bottle. The alleged ancient artificial
feeder discovered in Cyprus by Franz von
Löher was probably no more than an old
traveller’s gourd or wine-bottle. As late
as the fifteenth century the only kind of
infant-feeding, other than breast-feeding
by the mother, that was known, was that
which a foster-mother, or so-called wet-nurse,
could provide. Metlinger in 1473
appears to be the first to mention cow’s
milk as a substitute, and Rosslin comes
next, in 1522, with a theory about egg-yolk
and bread-mash. But these men
speak of these substitutes as applicable
only in case of extreme need, and there is
nothing to suggest that the practice of
artificial feeding was common.</p>

<p class='c015'>At all events, it is safe to say that the
vast expansion of artificial feeding, as we
know it to-day, is something quite recent
and new; and, since there appears to be
no doubt that, qualitatively, human milk
is quite inimitable, it is impossible to calculate
the damage which the latest development
of “Progress” may ultimately do
to the spirits and bodies of civilized men.</p>

and their future is foretold.</p>
<p class='c015'>Now, if we are right in inferring from
the many signs and portents to which
attention has been called, that our values
are largely body-despising values, and
that modern conditions already reveal
these values well on their way to a complete
triumph; if we are right, moreover,
in recognizing in modern degeneration,
science, Feminism, Puritanism, and the
increasing cleavage between the sexes the
logical outcome of these values, then there
can be but two possible alternatives for
the future: either the complete realization
of the desiderata implicit in these body-despising
values, or else a revolt against
them, the strength for which will be
drawn from the æsthetic, older, and
more healthy side of our nature. As
both of these alternatives are possible,
and, moreover, each will mean a different
future for women, it will be necessary to
examine them separately.</p>

<p class='c015'>Dealing first with the future which will
result from the complete realization of
the desiderata implicit in our body-despising
values, we must now recall the
main tendencies of the present day, so
that we may discover whither they must
necessarily lead.</p>

<p class='c015'>We have seen that in our present world
we have:</p>

<p class='c015'>(<b>a</b>) A population the bulk of which are
physiologically sub-human, and frivolously
oblivious of this fact. It is a population,
therefore, to which the value of
Life and Love is beginning to be a matter
of doubt, and among which Puritanical
prejudices are likely to become a spontaneous
growth where they are not already
present. Puritanism, however, must
also bring about this indirect and unexpected
result: that, where it prevails, man
is likely to become an object of general
disapproval; because, since the desires
of the body are regarded as sinful, man
as the initiator, instigator, and active
agent in the sexual encounter, will gradually
appear as the traditional villain of
creation, the natural butt of all gratuitous
moral indignation.</p>

<p class='c015'>(<b>b</b>) A body of sciences and commercial
enterprises which, guided by body-despising
values, tends rather to provide
us with an extra-corporeal equipment for
our declining bodies than to aim at
restoring to us our pristine functions and
original corporeal equipment. This enhances
our doubt concerning the value
of Love and Life, though it helps us to
“carry on.”</p>

<p class='c015'>(<b>c</b>) A marked decline in the ability,
versatility, and masculinity of men, which
is the outcome partly of physical and
partly of intellectual inferiority, brought
about on the one hand by besotting and
cramping labour for generations, and, on
the other, by the deliberate attempt,
throughout Anglo-Saxon civilization and
its imitations, to limit the notion of
manliness to martial bravery and proficiency
at sports. This has led to a
loss of mastery over all things which is
far from edifying, and has enabled women
during the last century and recently to
draw unduly favourable comparisons
between themselves and men—which,
while comprehensible in the circumstances,
give quite a distorted view of
the situation. It is the case of two
climbers, M. and W. who, while ascending
a hill, find that, through the sudden
weakness of M., W.’s pace appears to be
wonderfully enhanced. W., however, interprets
M.’s retrograde movement not
as abnormal weakness but as accelerated
speed on her part, and therefore feels
contempt for M. as M., not merely as
enfeebled M.</p>

<p class='c015'>(<b>d</b>) A large body of disgruntled women,
mostly unmarried, who, having turned
away from Life and Love either through
lack of mates or the nausea acquired in
modern matrimony, are prepared to
slander not only Life, but also motherhood,
domesticity, and Man, and who, in
their conscious or unconscious jealousy
of younger women and girls, try to convince
the latter that life can be lived
happily without bodily adaptation.</p>

<p class='c015'>(<b>e</b>) Social circumstances which force
millions of women into open competition
with men, and therefore increase the
initial hostility fostered by (<b>a</b>), (<b>c</b>), and
(<b>d</b>).</p>

<p class='c015'>(<b>f</b>) A state of abnormality so acute in
some of the chief functions connected
with the sexual life that more and more
cogent arguments are found ready to hand
for those who, through Puritanism, jealousy
of the rising generation, or hostility
to the male, wish to slander life and
emancipate themselves <i>and others</i> from
“<i>that</i> side of it.”</p>

<p class='c015'>(<b>g</b>) A movement known as Feminism,
generated chiefly by (<b>a</b>), (<b>c</b>), and (<b>d</b>),
and greatly reinforced by (<b>e</b>) and (<b>f</b>),
but having also a strong trace of (<b>b</b>) in
its attitude, which claims that it can recruit
among its own supporters the mastery,
ability, and strength to put the world
right, and which proposes to do so by
superseding man everywhere, if possible,
even in his reproductive rôle.</p>

<p class='c015'>This is the picture at a glance. To
what can it lead?</p>

<p class='c015'>The history of all reforms and radical
innovations in this world has shown that
far-reaching changes are always the work
of a leading, active, gifted, and small
minority, striving with zeal and determination
to realize an ideal. This ideal
may be based on misconception or on
error; but that does not matter. In the
end, the wilful minority establishes the
environment, or mould, and the inert,
ductile masses pour into it and receive
their shape.</p>

<p class='c015'>Now there is not a particle of doubt in
anybody’s mind that the leading, active,
and gifted minority now constituting
the van of the Women’s Movement, are
by far the most vital and energetic body
of women in the civilized world, admirable
in their zeal, and noble in their readiness
to shoulder the responsibility of setting
things right. This does not prevent us,
however, from believing them mistaken
in their reading of the situation, and
pathetic in their illusions about their own
and their sex’s capacities. So indefatigable
are they, indeed, that large numbers
of apparently monorchid and shallow-minded
men have already gone over to
their side; while the conversion of girls
and young women to a sexless life is one
of the least obvious but most pernicious
results of their activities. And, since
there appears to be no general recognition
that our present state of muddle and lack
of mastery over all things is the outcome
of masculine degeneracy; since, moreover,
there seems to be no attempt made
to discover how man himself can recover
his quota of manly qualities, it is not only
possible, but highly probable, that the
mass of mankind, through not having its
attention called to the only remedy,
which is the regeneration of man, will,
out of sheer lack of principles and policies,
see in the quack-cure of Feminism their
only hope.</p>

<p class='c015'>Given, therefore, the persistence of the
body-despising values, and the conditions
to which they give rise, we may expect to
see the energetic minority of women, who
now lead the Feminist movement, determine
the future of their sex; and, if we
watch them and try to understand them,
we shall be in a position to describe the
world they will call into existence.</p>

<p class='c015'>We have seen that Feminism is not
only the outcome of the modern world’s
main characteristics, but also that it
embodies these characteristics as elements
in its general attitude. Truth to tell, if
we take our values as given, together
with all the results they were sure to
bring about, then Feminism was a foregone
conclusion from the start.</p>

<p class='c015'>Neglect and degeneration of the body
were bound to lead to a loathing of the
body and the wish to be emancipated
from its thraldom. This, however, necessarily
destroyed one of the chief bonds
between man and woman, and left the
natural and radical hostility of the sexes
naked and unconstrained. This is one
side of Feminism.</p>

<p class='c015'>Next we have the fact that physical
neglect and degeneration were also bound
to lead to the decline of man as the male,
both in the material and in the spiritual
senses. This, in its turn, led on the one
hand to our lack of mastery in everything,
which caused women to wonder
whether they could not help to clear up
the muddle; and, on the other, to a
growing contempt of man’s powers, and,
as we have seen, to an exaggerated notion
of woman’s. This is the other side of
Feminism.</p>

<p class='c015'>To complete the movement, all that
we required was, (<b>a</b>) a large body of
disgruntled females, either spinsters or
wives, all ready to slander life and man;
and (<b>b</b>) economic pressure driving
women into open competition with men in
all paid employment. Both these conditions
having been fulfilled, the rest
naturally followed.</p>

<p class='c015'>The first indication we had that
Feminism consisted of these elements was
the fact that the old passionate calls to
which women once responded gradually
began to yield before calls of mere vanity
and to the desire for notoriety. Numbers
of women no longer showed the old
eagerness to express physical passion, or
the old sad resignation when it was rebuffed:
they were content with gratifying
their vanity in every kind of sterile
pursuit that gave them the appearance of
being important.</p>

<p class='c015'>Without any promise whatsoever of
doing better than degenerate men, and
certainly without any past record of
achievement that would justify us in
expecting wonders from them—for in
those departments of life over which they
have held supreme sway for thousands
of years the most deplorable muddle
and ignorance prevail<a id='r10' /><a href='#f10' class='c018'><sup>[10]</sup></a>—they claimed
municipal and even parliamentary power,
they sought prominence even in empty
privileges, such as the right of sitting
among the Peers; and were triumphant
when, at last, they figured in a position
which has naturally excited the abhorrence
of all decent men for centuries—the
jury box.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f10'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r10'>10</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i>Vide</i> Chapter X of <i>Woman: A Vindication</i>.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>The whole change revealed in the
leaders of the movement and numbers of
their followers a transmutation of the
once powerful bodily passion into something
more feeble, more volatile, and
more exclusively dependent on vanity;
while accompanying it throughout were
the two elements growing daily more acute—the
longing to be rid of the thraldom
of sex, and hostility to man, which these
women like to see more general.</p>

<p class='c015'>Nothing startling has come of women’s
political power, and we can prophesy
with perfect confidence that nothing ever
will; even when, as may quite possibly
happen, Parliament consists only of
females. So far, the measures they have
introduced or clamoured for have indicated
merely a continuation and intensification
of the Puritanical tradition, but
not a sign of anything hopeful or new, in
the sense that it was beyond degenerate
men.</p>

<p class='c015'>But the very demand for the vote was,
in itself, merely a confirmation of the
view, held by ourselves and a few others,
that no possible good could come from
Feminism, that it offered no hope of a
better world, and that it was a quack
remedy for our sickness. For, if there
had been any intrinsic quality in it, any
political or other genius peculiarly feminine
and foreign in kind and degree to
anything found in man, how can we explain
that one of its first claims was to
obtain a political privilege, the futility
and undesirability of which had been
demonstrated <i>ad nauseam</i> long before
this century dawned? Modern democracy
with its political machinery is so
thoroughly discredited, and is moreover
such a menace to our national greatness,
that, if there had been any social acumen
or shrewdness in woman, she would have
proved it by utterly scouting this political
<i>faux pas</i> of degenerate manhood. A
creative woman’s movement, if such an
idea can possibly be conceived, would
have introduced something new and
hopeful into our political life. It might,
at least, have tried to resuscitate the best
in our pre-democratic past; and, even
if it did not show this amount of flair,
it might, when it got the vote, straight-way
have shown its power by initiating
reforms that are peculiarly within
woman’s province. It might have
demanded a reform of our food-conditions,
and of the proprietary-food,
patent-medicine and culinary-aid industries,
which are in a scandalous state; or
a reform of the conditions under which
midwifery is practised in this country.
But it neither attempted, nor showed any
inclination to attempt, any one of these
feats. It demanded the preposterous
vote; and, having got it, proceeded, both
in Parliament and out, to try to effect
only Puritanical reforms, some of which
were frankly hostile to men.</p>

<p class='c015'>We are likely to suffer a rude awakening,
therefore, if we look to Feminism for
any marked improvement in our affairs.
Nobody with any profound understanding
of woman’s nature, and of her past
achievements, can possibly expect it.
What we can expect, however, when once
the forces of Feminism are completely
organized, is a systematic intensification
of all the tendencies that have culminated
in the modern Women’s Movement.</p>

<p class='c015'>The hostility to man and the jealousy
of happy and passionate youth, felt by
all disaffected women, whether spinsters
or wives, is sure to lead to every effort
being made to lure girls more and more
from bodily happiness. We can, therefore,
expect an increasing emancipation
of girls and women from domestic arts
and duties, together with an aggravation
of our present vices regarding foods.
This will be accompanied by the intensive
manufacture of every kind of condensed,
preserved, compressed, and synthetic
food, with a corresponding multiplication
of aids to minimize trouble in food-preparation.
The ideal will be a standardized
and complete food, containing
its own correctives for failing digestion,
to be obtained probably in tabloid form,
and requiring no further preparation
whatsoever. Ultimately, there can be
little doubt that this form of food will be
discovered, and may possibly become the
product of a special Government Department.
Meanwhile, the human system
will have undergone years of painful
attempted adaptation to increasingly bad
food-conditions, and acute indigestion,
with repeated intestinal operations, will
probably have become as common as
dental caries and tooth-extraction are
to-day.</p>

<p class='c015'>The tendency as regards men will be
to rear ever larger numbers of them along
the lines already indicated by modern taste—that
is to say, their manliness will be
limited more and more to military courage
and proficiency at games. Thus, while
they will prove increasingly harmless and
amenable to female rule—as Aristotle said
such men always would—they will be even
more besotted, more lacking in mastery,
will-power and understanding, more feeble
as lovers, and more contemptible than the
men of to-day.</p>

<p class='c015'>We can expect an increasing assertion
of the rights of females in every branch
of industry, commerce, and the professions,
accompanied by such a multiplication
of ready workers that competition
between the sexes will become acute.
The first moment of violent strain will
occur when women employers and women
labour-leaders, both working under
Feminist guidance, appropriate certain
industries wholly to female labour. This
will be accompanied by a vast extension
of an idea already materialized—the
female bank, that is to say, financial
houses and interests devoted entirely to
the women’s cause. Epicene organizations
and staffs will then tend to disappear,
and soon the national industry will
be divided into two sections, each of which
will be conducted by and for one sex
only, and in which the most poorly paid
workers will belong to the other sex.
These two sections will confront each
other jealously like two competing nations,
and, while each will try to encroach on
the domain and wealth of the other, it will
also try to compass the other’s failure.</p>

<p class='c015'>Occasionally this bitter rivalry will
lead to riots and savage street-fighting,
in which, owing to the fact that moral
indignation will always be on the side of
the women, the men are certain to be
routed, and to lose credit, prestige, and
lives. In any case, owing to the continued
besotment of men, the female domain
will steadily corrode and eat into
the male, and soon men will cease to be
employers altogether, and become the
poorest-paid workers in an industry run
entirely by women.</p>

<p class='c015'>Abetting and assisting this movement,
we shall see engineering and machinery
so much perfected that skill in operative
work will entirely vanish. A team of
intelligent monkeys will then be adequate
for the productive work of the nation,
and, with this final blow at the spiritual
and physical qualifications of both sexes,
women will overrun every department of
production. This development was
adumbrated during the Great War, when
it was found that, although 5,000,000
men had left their work, girls and women
easily took it over. Hundreds of thousands
of these men imagined that they
had been doing both skilled and manly
work. The ease with which they were
replaced by inexperienced girls and
women proved that they were wrong. It
also proved, incidentally, that such was
the extent of our urban degeneration and
emasculation that only the fewest among
the peace-occupations of the country were
essentially masculine or demanded masculine
qualifications.</p>

<p class='c015'>Meanwhile, owing to health having
suffered a further decline, owing to
motherhood having become more and
more distressing, and owing to sexual and
bodily joys having become more completely
suspect, celibacy among women
will be more common than it is at present,
and legislation may have to be passed to
compel a greater percentage of wage-earners
to marry. To help increase the
population, greater benefits will be conferred
on parents than ever before. But,
as by this time it will be becoming more
and more plain that man is growing
superfluous except as a fertilizer and a
soldier, and as, through his contemptible
condition, the feeling will be gaining
ground that it is an indignity for a free
female citizen to live in intimacy with
him simply in order to provide the state
with children, there may be an attempt
to legalize marriage by proxy, accompanied
by scientific fertilization without
actual congress with any man personally
known to the woman. Artificial impregnation
will tend to become common,
and women—the wealthiest and most
embittered foremost—will soon give up
ordinary marriage altogether and choose
to have children without concourse with
the other sex. The whole act of fertilization
will be consummated in the surgery,
just as vaccination is now. There are
signs even to-day that this revolt against
cohabitation is spreading, and there are
not a few women who, either in their
Puritanism or jealousy of their happier
sisters, would be glad to see it become
more common.</p>

<p class='c015'>Keeping pace with these changes,
lactation will wholly disappear, and, even
among the lowest women, it will be regarded
very much as cannibalism is to-day.
Pictures and statues of women in
the act of suckling will be mutilated, destroyed,
or hidden from the public view,
just as a certain class of Greek statues are
now mutilated and concealed; while the
ideal of beauty in the female will be a
creature completely flat-chested and with
the hips of a youth. Girls and women
who happen to throw back to the ancestral
type will be pitied, and may even be
operated upon, just as people with facial
blemishes are now.</p>

<p class='c015'>Meanwhile modifications will have
occurred in the relations of the sexes.
The congress of male and female will
have begun to seem much more guilty
and disgusting even than it is to-day,
and as the male will still be looked upon
(as he is now) as the principal culprit in
the matter, the age of consent will
probably be extended to thirty-five or
forty, if not to the menopause. Seduction
and rape will be punished brutally,
probably by means of emasculation; and
men of vigorous sexuality will be eliminated
in order to make way for a generation
of low-sexed, meek, and sequacious
lackeys.</p>

<p class='c015'>It will not be long before even the
necessity for male soldiers will vanish.
When the manipulation of the engines of
war becomes as simple as typing or making
tea, girls and women will make just
as efficient soldiers as men; and, since
war will then be carried on without
visualizing the enemy, all that will be
required will be an army of obedient
operatives, who will not need the traditional
courage and endurance of the male
in the face of the foe.</p>

<p class='c015'>When once artificial impregnation is
an every-day occurrence, a Parliament
of women will doubtless pass legislation
to make it illegal for any man to procreate
a child naturally, if it is the wife’s desire
to have one by the intermediation of
science; and, no matter how many children
she may wish to have in this way, he
will be compelled to support them. This,
however, will be the final blow to marriage.
Hundreds of thousands of women
will still be naturally fertilized, but they
will be despised, and form a class apart.
Social prejudice will be against them, and
movements will be started to emancipate
and rescue them, just as there are movements
to-day to rescue harem-women.
Jealousy will still play a part in this
movement; but, owing to the deplorable
degeneration of men as lovers and mates,
it will be fainter than ever before.</p>

<p class='c015'>There will, of course, be fluctuations
in this development, and some decades
will reveal shameful lapses into matrimony
and natural fertilization. Then
the Lysistratas of the Feminist world,
burning with indignation once more, will
be heard crying aloud, just as Lysistrata
cried over two thousand years ago in
Greece:</p>

<p class='c024'>“ἐγὼ μὲν οὖν αὐτὰς ἀποσχεῖν οὐκέτι
οἵα τ᾽ ἀπὸ τῶν ἀνδρῶν· διαδιδράσκουσι γάρ.”</p>
<p class='c019'>(I can no longer hold the minxes. They
are running to the men; they are deserting).—Aristophanes,
<i>Lysistrata</i>, ll. 718-9.</p>
<p class='c015'>But the aggravated horrors of childbirth,
and the alarming increase in the
performance of the Cæsarian section,
together with the general surfeit of the
body and the intensified loathing of men,
will cause these retrograde movements to
diminish, and very soon such a clamour
will arise for extra-corporeal gestation
that science will be allowed no rest until
a technique is discovered that will meet
the public demand. The results achieved
by men like Alexis Carrel, Ebleing, and
Fische, all of whom are now working with
success on tissue-culture and the transplantation
of anatomical structures from
one living organism to another, will be
improved upon, and a means will be discovered
by which the fertilized ovum will
be matured outside the female body.</p>

<p class='c015'>At first, we venture to predict, this will
occur by again enlisting the cow or the
ass into our service. Science already
suspects that vital fluids are not specific,
and it is probable, therefore, that in the
early days of extra-corporeal gestation,
the fertilized human ovum will be transferred
to the uterus of a cow or an ass,
and left to mature as a parasite on the
animal’s tissues, very much as the newborn
baby is now made the parasite of
the cow’s udder. And, with this innovation,
we shall probably suffer increased
besotment, and intensified bovinity or
asininity, according to the nature of the
quadruped chosen. Thus extra-corporeal
gestation, or “ectogenesis” (to use a
word coined by Mr J. B. S. Haldane for
the purpose) will become a possibility,
and the Feminist ideal of complete emancipation
from the thraldom of sex will
be realized.</p>

<p class='c015'>Fresh legislation will now be passed,
which will make it a felony for a man to
give a woman a child in the old corporeal
sense, and any male found guilty of such
an offence will be sentenced to death or
else to a long term of hard labour. In
view of the initial heavy cost of extra-corporeal
gestation, however, public
centres will be provided where the
Borough Council will undertake to
“grow” children for the destitute and
the poor.</p>

<p class='c015'>A little later on, of course, this artificial
aid will be perfected, and even the cow
will become unnecessary. The fertilized
ovum, cultivated in embryonic tissue-juice,
will then be independent of the
foster uterus of animals, and will mature
very much as chickens now do in incubators.</p>

<p class='c015'>These discoveries are all potential in
the scientific achievements of our day,
and implicit in our values. All they need
to bring them into existence is the further
direction of these values, together with
the continued anti-sexual and anti-masculine
bias of Feminism.</p>

<p class='c015'>With this final blow levelled at the
corporeal equipment of sex, triumphant
Feminism will probably reach its zenith,
and in a few generations a kind of woman
will appear the only vestige of whose sex
will be her smooth face and primary
genital glands. Men will then be frankly
regarded as quite superfluous. Having
lost their powers, first as spiritual and
bodily leaders, secondly as masters and
lovers, thirdly as skilled craftsmen and
soldiers, and fourthly as specialized
workers, their social use will have lapsed,
and their numbers will begin to be felt
as a source of irritation and even indignation.</p>

<p class='c015'>At this stage the social muddle will
have become so intricate, and have grown
so alarmingly out of hand, that nothing
but the most drastic and sweeping changes
will be able to prolong the life of the
community. A shortage of food, occasioned
by difficulties arising in the
Government Department responsible for
food-preparation and food-distribution,
will give the signal for the last and most
bitter sex-struggle. Either through incompetent
administration or the revolt
of the workers, there will be a threat of
starvation. No food will be made for
weeks, stores will be on the point of being
depleted, and panic will reign everywhere;
when suddenly a few of the leading
women will perceive with apocalyptic clarity
not only that the superfluity of men has
become a burden on the community and
a menace to the food of the children, but
also that the reduction of their numbers
to the barest minimum indispensable for
the purposes of fertilization would be a
twofold boon—it would relieve the food-crisis
both for the moment and possibly
also for the future, and obviate for ever
the danger of a masculine or slave rising.</p>

<p class='c015'>A sex-fight at the distributing station
of a large store will suffice to light the
first spark of this new conflagration. A
dead set will be made against the men,
not only round the original focus of the
trouble, but everywhere. The legislature,
recognizing their opportunity, will
support the popular fury, and proceed
to a systematic slaughter of males, until,
with the help of the regular troops, it
will be found necessary to protect and
preserve a small nucleus for next year’s
fertilization.</p>

<p class='c015'>By that time, however, a significant
precedent will have been established, and
a lesson learnt that will not easily be
forgotten. The superfluousness of men
above a certain essential minimum (about
5 to every 1,000 women) will have become
recognized officially and unofficially as a
social fact. The legislature will establish
laws to guarantee that this minimum
should not be surpassed, and in a very
short while it will become a mere matter
of routine to proceed to an annual
slaughter of males who have either
outlived their prime or else have failed
to fulfil the promise of their youth in
meekness, general emasculateness, and
stupidity.</p>

<p class='c015'>The only circumstance that can avert
this ultimate development is the discovery
by science of a means of determining the
sex of the ovum. If this can be done,
then, of course, only a certain small
number of males (½%) will be reared
every year, and the periodical slaughter
will be avoided. But in this connection
it should be remembered that man will
long since have grown too dull to be
capable of scientific wonders of any kind;
and, as it is not in woman’s nature to be
inventive or to make great discoveries,
the probability is that society will petrify
at the level of mechanical and scientific
progress reached at the moment of man’s
most serious decline, and, therefore, that
the periodical slaughter of males will
remain just as much a necessity with
the human female workers as with the
worker-bees.</p>

<p class='c015'>Meanwhile, to these millions of workers
life will have become little more than a
dreary, colourless, and hopeless round of
toil and self-sacrifice. The only sources
of excitement and pleasure will be the
pastimes offering chances for public
parade and appeals to vanity, the criticism
of the latest Government foods and their
corresponding digestive aids, and the
reading in the papers about the prosecution
of refractory female characters,
either for sedition, immorality, or indolence.
Under immorality will be included
all attempts at writing, reading, or circulating
any poem, novel, or treatise
faintly reminiscent of love as we now
know it, all attempts at unearthing or
recalling the “obscene” literature of
former ages—particularly the romantic
fiction of the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries and all efforts to draw, paint,
carve, or otherwise represent any graphic
image of barbaric woman, when she still
bore on her body the traces of the
corporeal equipment for motherhood.</p>

<p class='c015'>Looking round upon this cold, hard,
and business-like world, however, in
which the unremitting industry, so much
exalted by Maeterlinck, will be the only
activity and almost the only interest, it
is not unlikely that millions of these
female workers will ask themselves, with
ever increasing perplexity and distress,
what purpose it all serves, what good it
all does, and what advantage or pleasure
they derive from it. In their lives of
stoic “purity” and monotonous bread-winning
alone, they are likely to discover
that even waiting for the end is intolerable,
and many who will regard the
normal term of human life as an unmerciful
prolongation of their inexplicable
misery will have recourse to all possible
means of terminating their hardships.
Gradually it will dawn upon a few independent
and rebellious spirits that to have
attempted to live like spirits before the
spirit-world was reached, to have attempted
to extinguish the joys and thrills of
the body and to taste of the interests of
angels, before having shuffled off this
mortal coil—in fact to have planned and
organized an æsthetic phenomenon such
as life without retaining its æsthetic side,
was a tragic and utterly brutal blunder.
By the time, however, that this inevitable
discovery is made—the only great discovery
that an exclusively female community
is ever likely to make—those
who will be responsible for it will look
aghast upon their own and their sisters’
bodies; and, perceiving with horror the
impossibility at that late hour of recovering
the functions, powers, and bodily
parts, which centuries of disuse and
degeneration will have withered to
nothing, they will, if they still have enough
spirit left, execrate and curse the memory
of those who first envisaged their state
as a future possibility, and who, having
once conceived it as desirable, deliberately
planned and schemed to bring it about.</p>

<p class='c015'>“Almighty God,” they will cry in
desperation, “mercifully spared the bees
our consciousness!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c013'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <br /><span class='sc'>Future Woman</span></h2>
</div>
<p class='c014'><span class='sc'>The</span> picture, given in the last chapter, of
the world that is likely to result from the
extreme consequences of our present
tendencies may seem overdrawn and
fantastic; but it should not be too readily
dismissed as absurd on that account.
The fact that, as a whole, it may seem
incredible is no argument against the
inevitability of certain of its chief
characteristics; for it should always be
remembered that, since the main stream
of human life as we now know it, is
based upon the bodily relation of the
sexes and upon the love which makes this
relation a thing desired, all influences
tending to deteriorate the human body
or to upset that bodily relation, and all
scientific technique and substitutes which
tend to supersede it, must, if they are
allowed to develop, lead to a dislocation
so complete of the original scheme that
there is no telling in what monstrous
changes they may culminate.</p>
<p class='c015'>Had we not already reached bodily
degeneration, brought about and condoned
by body-despising values; had we
not a Puritanical tradition reinforced by
Feminism; and, finally, had we not a
group of sciences whose discoveries, either
actual or potential, allow us to expect
every kind of extra-corporeal substitute
and aid for our defective corporeal
functions and parts, we could afford to
laugh at the dangers indicated in the
previous chapter. In view, however, of
the undeniable truth of the description
of our state previously given, it is impossible
lightly to reject the ultimate
evanescence of sexual love, for instance,
as a remote future development. And,
if we admit that, we must reckon with the
disappearance of our most effective protection
against the instinctive hostility
of the sexes.</p>

<p class='c015'>It is for this reason that there is still a
fight to be fought with Feminism, and
why we ourselves, though heart and soul
pro-feminine, still remain active anti-Feminists.
People point to the victories
of Feminism in recent years, and say:
What is there left for active anti-Feminists
to do? Now that women have
the vote and that they sit in Parliament,
now that they have practically the whole
of the Press behind them, their battle is
surely won, and anti-Feminism is a lost
cause! Obviously, however, if anti-Feminism
means resisting the further
development of Feminism, to prevent it
from culminating in some or all of the
changes outlined in the previous chapter;
if it means a struggle to maintain the
natural relations of the sexes, together
with the normal functioning of male and
female in reproduction; and if it also
means the retention of the family, the
home, and some beauty in our social
scheme, then it certainly cannot yet be
a lost cause, and those who, like ourselves,
remain anti-Feminists despite the
Feminine Franchise, the Feminist Press,
and the Woman Μ. P., feel that we have
still much to protect and much to achieve
before we can regard our position as
hopeless.</p>

<p class='c015'>Fortunately, however, there is an
alternative to the developments described
in the last chapter—an alternative which,
if we so choose, we may well be able to
bring about quite as certainly as the
future already outlined. But, if we are
in earnest about this alternative future,
and if we seriously wish to realize it, we
must not forget that, since the other is
more or less implicit in our present trend,
and will evolve automatically out of it
if only we continue to acquiesce in everything
that constitutes modernity, this
other, or alternative, future will require
to be actively fought for.</p>

<p class='c015'>The future is in our hands, and we can
mould it as we will—certainly! But, as
we have seen, it is also as potential in the
present as a flower is potential in the bud.
While, therefore, the future sketched in
the last chapter—or, at all events, very
essential parts of it—will come without
any special effort on our part, merely as a
further growth of existing tendencies, the
alternative future, which we now propose
to describe, will, if it is to be realized,
demand from us not only the hardness
and determination of iconoclasts, but
also the creative gifts, patience, and
constructive energy of builders.</p>

<p class='c015'>There is much in our present that must
be destroyed, and even more that will
subsequently require building and re-building.</p>

<p class='c015'>Among the first things that we shall
destroy is our table of value. We shall
do this, however, not in the spirit of
anarchists eager only for greater licence
and more “freedom”—for that is always
the temptation of the mob, and requires
no particular courage or constructive
programme; but in the spirit of builders
who want more discipline for greater
achievement.</p>

<p class='c015'>The first values to be destroyed will be
the body-despising values, and everything
connected with them. We shall no
longer condone ugliness or physiological
depravity either in ourselves or in
others. The fact that some bodily
defect cannot be helped by the man who
reveals it does not make him any the
more desirable. We shall remember that,
strictly speaking, moral depravity is no
more voluntary than physiological depravity;
and, since we refuse to accept
the excuse <i>mea non culpa</i> for moral
depravity, it is only logical and right to
reject that same excuse for bodily
depravity. Why is it important not to
accept this excuse for bodily depravity?
Because to condone is to overlook, to
condone is to accept, and, above all, to
condone is to become accustomed to.
Where physiological depravity is a
matter of custom, however, it very soon
ceases, as we know, to be regarded as
depravity; and mating, love-making,
and procreation quickly become possible
in spite of it. That is why it is more
important to alter our values than to
promote Eugenic legislation. For, if our
values are altered and physiological
depravity is no longer condoned, Eugenic
legislation will become unnecessary, and
will be anticipated by the taste of the
people; whereas, if our body-despising
values remain intact, Eugenic legislation
will always be fighting an up-hill fight.</p>

<p class='c015'>The most difficult feature connected
with the task of suppressing our body-despising
values is the duty it enjoins on
each individual not only of condemning
his neighbour but also of condemning
himself, if he is physiologically depraved;
but this each of us will learn to do. We
shall feel the shame of bodily defects
once more, and strive unremittingly to
recover bodies complete anatomically
beautiful, and no longer defective functionally.
Even at the risk of great
immediate suffering, we shall learn to
eschew artificial aids of all kinds, and
regard it as beneath our dignity to use
them. Then, since very little is beyond
the wit of man, other means will be
found, and we shall recover our former
bodily splendour.</p>

<p class='c015'>We must bear in mind, however, that
we are almost at the eleventh hour; that
to-morrow may be too late; and that,
if we wish to spare ourselves the great
discovery of the desolate women-workers
of the previous chapter, there is no time
to lose.</p>

<p class='c015'>Secondly, we shall destroy the value
which makes it noble, virtuous, and
desirable to sacrifice the greater for the
less. This value also belongs to the
group of values which Dean Inge supports,
despite his apparent enthusiasm
about Eugenics,<a id='r11' /><a href='#f11' class='c018'><sup>[11]</sup></a> and is among the greatest
causes of modern degeneracy. When
once you admit the principle that it is
noble and virtuous to sacrifice the greater
for the less, the desirable for the undesirable,
the corn for the weeds, the god
for the mob, you necessarily invite the
condition which we find around us
to-day. Everything that is best in the
nation, all those elements on which the
successful survival of our race depends,
are being penalized and sacrificed for the
sake of the defective, the lunatic, the
crippled, the incurable, the half-witted,
and the blind. Honours are acquired
not for promoting the multiplication of
the sound and hale, but for promoting
the comfort, ease, and daily welfare of
the physiologically and spiritually hopeless.
This value must go. Its disappearance
will clear the air. So long,
however, as one sound family in England
continues to be penalized even to the
extent of only sixpence a year in order to
support humanity’s wreckage and rubbish,
we shall continue to be sacrificing the
greater to the less. This absurd and
degenerate value must be transvalued
into the following: <i>It is noble and virtuous
to sacrifice the less for the greater,
the rubbish for the precious.</i> When once
this transvaluation has been effected, we
shall begin to ascend.</p>

<div class='fn'>

<div class='footnote' id='f11'>
<p class='c019'><span class='label'><a href='#r11'>11</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Another instance of his astonishing confusion
of thought.</p>
</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>Thirdly, we shall recognize the error
of our modern conception of masculinity.
We shall try to forget the Great War,
which at present tempts us to think
highly of ourselves; and we shall endeavour
to understand that to limit the
notion of masculinity to proficiency in
sports and bravery in war is to overlook
a whole catalogue of masculine virtues
without which degeneration can hardly
fail to overtake us in spite of all our
games and our feats of arms. This
limitation of the idea of manliness to
proficiency in sport and bravery in war
is acceptable to women, because it makes
for a breed of men who are easily led and
still more easily misled; but it is fatal to
civilization. We shall learn to expect of
the manly man not only courage and
proficiency in sport, but also will-power,
leadership, mastery over the mysteries of
life, and not Puritanical funk in their
presence, intelligence sufficient to overshadow
any female brain that is placed
alongside of him (a feature notoriously
absent both in the average soldier and in
the average sportsman, or at least, if not
absent in, not essential to), and clarity
and decision regarding every problem
that it concerns him to understand—in
fact, a man whose presence alone makes
the claim of sexual equality a manifest
and transparent absurdity.</p>

<p class='c015'>Nothing less should satisfy us; for we
shall always remember that it was the
man who possesses merely courage and
proficiency at sport that is responsible
not only for all our present muddle, but
also for Feminism.</p>

<p class='c015'>Here again, therefore, we shall recast
our values, and, hard as it may seem,
discipline ourselves to a new outlook.
Nothing else can save the world and
nothing else can put woman back in her
place—which is only another way of
saving the world. Every other remedy is
quackery. The highest type of this kind
of manly man is the ruler who gives us a
new order and a new goal; while even the
lowest type is the husband who fills a
woman’s life and whom she finds it a joy
to obey and no indignity, no hardship to
serve. Without this kind of man in large
numbers in our midst, the world cannot
fail to go hopelessly astray, and it will be
our principal object henceforth to discover
not only how he can be restored to
us, but how it is that, during the last
hundred years, we have failed to produce
him in England. This is the only kind
of scientific research that can possibly be
fruitful of good results at the present
juncture, and it is the first direction in
which we shall turn our remaining energy.
Nor need we be deterred by the journalistic
scoffers who will tell us that we are
in search of that mythical monster the
Superman, for we have no such highfalutin’
schemes. The men we wish to
rear again have already been reared once
before in these islands, and history
records their lives. They are not a magic
fantasy, but a possible reality. They
are not demi-gods, but mortals. And
we ourselves, who claim that they are
indispensable for the salvation of modern
humanity, do not hope for them as a race
of Supermen, but merely as the leaders
of a Masculine Renaissance.</p>

<p class='c015'>With regard to the world these leaders
will create, and to the position of women
in that world, while we cannot safely
foretell what they will do, we venture to
suggest the following:</p>

<p class='c015'>We may expect a total and complete
exposure of the shallowness, impracticability,
and danger to national survival of
Democracy as we now understand it, and
therefore the evanescence of democratic
forms of government. The great suffering
and chaos to which such forms of government
lead will probably leave a deep
impression upon the soul of humanity,
and this impression will help the leaders
of the Masculine Renaissance to remodel
the national life without having recourse
to the discredited and preposterous vote.</p>

<p class='c015'>We may expect a revival of agriculture
and craftsmanship, because one of the
first things to be done is to arrest the
dry-rot in spirit and body, which industrial
and urban conditions have brought
about under the sway of the body-despising
values. Men will learn to
respect themselves once more, and this
they can do only by expressing their
highest impulses in their work. They
will become agriculturists and craftsmen
again, because this is the only way by
which they can recover their dignity, their
lost faculties, and their vanished health.</p>

<p class='c015'>We can also expect that science
instead of concentrating, as now, upon
providing us with ever more efficient
extra-corporeal equipment such as wireless
telegraphy, aeroplanes, etc., and
more and more substitutes and aids for
our defective bodies, will turn its research
in the direction of restoring to man bodily
perfection and to <i>extending the range of
his faculties</i>. It will probe the mystery
of powers like clairvoyance, and direct
healing (such as that effected by the laying
on of hands from time immemorial);
it will discover the mechanism (if any)
behind telepathy and behind the peculiar
magnetism of cultivated will-power, and
discover an educational technique by
which these properties and powers may
become more general, more efficient, and
more far-reaching. It will seek the
method behind the laws of heredity, and
establish principles whereby family and
stock qualities may be brought to
perfection. It will also sift the mass of
evidence and facts collected by modern
science, in order to co-ordinate the data,
and establish lines of proper conduct and
legitimate aspiration. Finally, it will aim
at co-ordinating religious and naturalistic
truths up to date, with the view of offering
to mankind a new faith, and a new
metaphysic, purged of the sick and degenerate
elements of former religions.</p>

<p class='c015'>Recognizing that æstheticism is an
essential part of terrestrial life, the
possession and expression of beauty will
no longer be relegated to certain sections
of the community, but will be made a
part of the national life. The Puritanical
prejudice against beauty and its lure will
be exploded, and beauty will be cultivated
in the human body as an indispensable
factor in a happy life. The old
Puritanical belief that it is possible to
have a beautiful soul, a beautiful
character, and a beautiful mind in an
ugly body with evil-smelling breath, will
have to be recognized for what it is—that
is, merely a <i>credo</i> for the comfort
of repulsive people.</p>

<p class='c015'>Meanwhile large hypertrophied cities
and towns will tend to disappear, and
the population will be thinned by rigorous
selection at birth. Abnormal, crippled,
defective, incurable, and undesirable
people will no longer be allowed to grow
up. Their uselessness and their danger
as a burden and an eye-sore will be
recognized. The old belief in the extreme
sacredness of every human creature,
irrespective of bodily and mental perfection,
will vanish, in order to make way
for a valuation based on quality of mind
and body. This gradual elimination of
the undesirable dregs of humanity with
all the physiological botchedness they
stand for, will clear the air, and relieve
coming generations of many heavy
burdens. The energy, spare wealth, and
spare time of the community, will then
be devoted to the desirable, and the
magnificent mansions which are now
distributed all over the country, for the
housing of human monsters, will be
converted into palaces for people of
promise.</p>

<p class='c015'>The regeneration of man will immediately
transform woman and her
position; because, while her contempt
for the male will vanish, she will recover
both physically and spiritually that lost
joy of <i>looking up</i> to her mate. Through
the mastery he will introduce, her present
very justifiable anxiety about the world
will tend to disappear, and the serenity
of a dependent existence will be restored
to her. Her life through being filled by
a mate sufficiently versatile to supply
her not only with offspring, but also with
every possible interest, will gradually lose
the feverish restlessness of the modern
woman, who is seeking constantly to
forget the void both in her heart and in
her existence; and in time she will learn
to measure at their proper worth the
vanities which now supply her with but
a poor substitute for her former bliss.</p>

<p class='c015'>With these changes, women’s claim to
equality with men will gradually cease
to be heard of. Here and there it may
still continue to be raised in some
quarters; but, the moment its absurdity
is made everywhere visible to the very
eye of onlookers, it will necessarily die
down. It is merely the fact that the
claim is not <i>manifestly</i> absurd to-day
that lends it for the time being a certain
fatal plausibility.</p>

<p class='c015'>But, before woman is sound enough in
body and mind to give birth to this new
breed of masculine sons, and to rear them
herself, she will undergo many transformations,
and learn to look at life from
a very different standpoint. In the first
place she will regenerate her own body
before it is too late, and recover the
ease, if not the ecstasy of old, in all her
functions. She will learn to despise herself
if she wears glasses, if she has false
or bad teeth, if she cannot function without
scientific aids, and if she cannot suckle
her child. She will perceive the boastful
levity of the present generation of
women who concern themselves more and
more with highfalutin’ interests and
matters of the soul, when all the while
they are not masters of their bodies. She
will see that a workman who wished to
leave his bench and his tools in order to
try to master high finance when he had
not yet mastered his trade, would very
justly become an object of derision, and
that modern women, with their feverish
interest in every new-fangled creed and
power, are also objects of derision,
because all the while their bodies grow
more and more out of hand.</p>

<p class='c015'>Helped by her men of science, she will
apply herself to the task of discovering
that mode of life and that diet which will
restore to her normal and easy functioning
in her digestive system; that mode of
life and diet during gestation which will
restore to her the joy of childbirth—a
joy that has probably not been known
to mankind for thousands of years—and,
without losing heart over her
initial failures, she will persevere until
the necessary discoveries are made.</p>

<p class='c015'>When once bodily normality is recovered—and
this will come about much
more speedily by a change of values, and
therefore by a change of taste, than by
legally enforced Eugenics—she and her
mate will attach a new value to life, and
a new value to motherhood, domesticity,
and marriage. All three will appear
nobler and more desirable, not only
because they have become more beautiful,
and more productive of beauty, but also
because their responsibilities and annoyances
<i>are endured for a man and for
children who make them appear thoroughly
worth while</i>.</p>

<p class='c015'>In Chapter II we pointed out the direction
in which inquiry might profitably be
directed in order to achieve certain
eminently desirable improvements in the
present conditions of childbirth. These
indications may prove to be misleading.
It is possible that their application may
be disappointing. This, however, should
not deter us. The ideas suggested in
Chapter II may or may not be of value;
but what is important is that inquiry
should be directed towards the goal to
which they point, and, if this end be
assiduously sought, it cannot fail to be
reached sooner or later. It must be
obvious to all that, by persisting in our
present direction of improved artificial
aids, we can never attain to anything
either good or desirable—therefore that
our present direction is manifestly wrong
and hopeless.</p>

<p class='c015'>The elimination of the bungled and
the botched, and a rigorous selection of
the newly-born on qualitative lines both
of mind and body, will so much relieve
the situation in all over-populated
districts that early marriages will become
a possibility again. Where it is difficult,
assistance will easily be found. For
where people acquire honour in helping
and promoting the best, instead of promoting
and helping the worst, the rich
will seek distinction in endowing desirable
people instead of endowing wrecks,
cripples, and incurables.</p>

<p class='c015'>When once these reforms have been
instituted, it will be possible to order life
on a much happier scale, particularly for
women. Since males and females are
normally about equal in number, the
increased prosperity will enable most men
to marry and most girls to find husbands,
and the misery of modern sexual abstinence
will cease for millions of women.
But, as happiness can be permanently
secured only if a nation cuts its coat
according to its cloth, careful measures
will have to be taken to keep the population
within certain limits. Seeing, however,
that birth-control and contraceptive
methods sacrifice the adults in order to
achieve this end, the tendency will be,
in a society whose principle it is to
sacrifice the less to the greater, to proceed
to some kind of controlled and legalized
infanticide. This will allow standards
governing infant-selection to be periodically
revised, and will thus lead to an
improvement of the race.</p>

<p class='c015'>Since, however, wars and the greater
danger attending male pursuits are always
likely to create a preponderance of
females in the community, concubinage
will be tolerated for the sake of the
surplus women; but, instead of its being
a concubinage like that of to-day, which
is hidden, secret, sterile, condemned, and
therefore productive of much distress
and tragedy, it will be open, tolerated,
recognized, and fruitful, just as it has
been in the best civilizations of the past.
There are other and very deep reasons
why some form of concubinage is essential.
I have already dealt with them elsewhere.<a id='r12' /><a href='#f12' class='c018'><sup>[12]</sup></a>
Suffice it to say here, however,
that no shame or discomfort will necessarily
attach to the life of the concubines.
They will be legally recognized; they will
have their social status; and they will be
protected by public opinion and by law.
Nor will they be encountered in every
household. As in former societies which
have recognized them, they will be found
only where their need is felt, and where
their own taste guides them to seek
protection.</p>

<p class='c015'>Women old enough for matrimony and
older, therefore, will tend to be withdrawn
more and more from industrial,
commercial, and public life, and the old
industries of the home—bread, cheese,
butter, jam, and confectionery making—will
be revived, and will flourish once
more. Under the guidance of science,
domestic medicine will gradually be transferred
from the doctor’s consulting-room
to the kitchen and the still-room, and
there it will remain, as it always ought to
have remained, and doctors and their
powers will tend to disappear. Children
will be much more the apprentices of their
parents than they are at present; the
duties of education will tend to be delegated
less and less to elders who are not
blood-relations; and parents will have
a higher sense of their responsibilities.
Education outside the home will be regarded—at
least for boys and girls under
fifteen—as a <i>pis aller</i>, more or less as we
to-day regard the various arrangements
that have to be made for orphans.</p>

<p class='c015'>Meanwhile, with improved bodies and
brighter wits, women will share with men
the joy of the developed faculties which,
as we have pointed out, it will be the object
of science to realize; and a richer and
more eventful intellectual and spiritual
life will be led, because humanity will be
able to apply itself to the pursuit of ever
loftier interests. We shall have greater
arts and greater religions, deeper thoughts
and a mightier grasp of reality; because,
having mastered our bodies and solved
once more the secret of their harmonious
working, we shall no longer be in
the difficult dilemma of mortals who,
with neglected and badly functioning
physiques, try to anticipate here on earth
the pastimes and pursuits of the immortal
world.</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;

with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of

1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT

PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
